ABOUT THE
NETWORK FOR
COLLEGE SUCCESS

he Network for College Success (NCS) envisions high schools
Tine continuously cultivate collaboration, powerful learning, and
a culture of high achievement to prepare all students for college
and career success.

NCS uses research to design and facilitate professional learning
that builds the capacity of school leaders to greatly improve
student outcomes. Through cross-school learning communities

and job-embedded coaching, we support district leaders, principals,
teachers, and counselors to:

¢ Strengthen school leadership

¢ Improve teaching and learning

¢ Support freshmen transitioning into high school

¢ Prepare students for quality postsecondary options

¢ Support culture and climate

e Integrate research and data into daily practice

NCS Core Values and Beliefs

¢« Educators have the capacity to solve their own problems when there is
actionable data, research-based strategies, collaborative teams, and
professional trust.

¢ School-based leaders drive change in schools. Increasing their capacity as
leaders is the essential lever for improvement.

¢« Students’ intellectual capacity is not static. lt grows when challenged
and develops when teachers explicitly build academic mindsets and
non-cognitive skills.

¢« Schools improve when educators make their practice public and critically
examine their work collaboratively. Trust is essential to people’s willingness to
engage in this process.

¢ Data analysis is a powerful tool for school improvement when used to trace

causes, seek solutions, and guide change. Data can be destructive when only
used to judge and punish.

¢« Challenging educators to interrupt inequities in schools and districts is vital
to improving schools. All students from all backgrounds deserve equitable
educational outcomes.

About the Toolkit

The NCS Freshman On-Track Toolkit is a collection of protocols, reports,
resources, and artifacts used by our experienced Coaches in their daily
work to help schools better support students through the critical first year
of high school.

A Capacity-Building Model for School Improvement paper accompanies the
Toolkit, capturing the NCS model and history, and situates our work within
current research. The Toolkit is organized around four key components:

What is On Track?

In Chicago, a student is considered On Track if he or she has accumulated
five full credits (ten semester credits) and has no more than one semester
F in a core subject (English, math, science, or social science) by the end
of freshman year. These represent the criteria to become a sophomore in
Chicago Public Schools. Students who are On Track are far more likely to
graduate from high school than their off track peers.

On Track may be defined differently in your school or district. For more
information about the origins of On Track in Chicago, please refer to the
Understanding Research & Applying Data component in this Toolkit.

Getting Started: The NCS
Freshman Success Framework

In 2009, the Network for College Success developed the Freshman Success
Framework to provide our partner schools with guidance on how to establish
a high-functioning system of support for students entering high school.

The three dimensions of the system - the actions of the team, its leader, and
the principal - are vital for helping freshmen successfully transition into high
school.

First, take a look at the Conceptual View of the Freshman Success Framework
on the next page. It provides a high-level overview of the content, conditions,
roles, and functions of freshman success work.

Next, dig into the the actual Freshman Success Framework, which is the
comprehensive roadmap for leading this work in your school. The Framework
details the necessary elements to create and implement a high-functioning
freshman success program. Done effectively, this will result in high freshman
course performance and ultimately high graduation rates.

What Matters for
Staying On-Track and
Graduating in Chicago
Public High Schools

Too many students in Chicago Public Schools and nationally fail to

graduate from high school. It is a problem that can sometimes feel
overwhelming to address because the causes of dropout are myriad
and complex. What is often lost in discussions about dropping out is
the one factor that is most directly related to graduation—students’
performance in their ninth grade courses. In this research report,
UChicago Consortium authors Elaine Allensworth and John Q.
Easton look into the elements of freshman course performance that
predict whether students will graduate and suggest what educators
can do to keep more teens in school.

Introduction

mproving graduation rates and reducing dropout rates are high-priority

items on the national agenda for high school reform. There is increasing
recognition that a high school diploma is a minimum requirement for success
in the workplace and that too few students obtain this minimum standard.'
Yet, it isa problem that can sometimes feel overwhelming to try to manage.
In part, this is because of the magnitude of the problem: nationally, nearly
one-third of students do not graduate from high school.” Almost half the
Chicago Public Schools (CPS) students fail to graduate from high school,
and in some CPS high schools more students drop out than graduate.” These
numbers underscore the urgency of addressing this issue immediately.

The dropout problem is also difficult to manage because its causes are
many and complex. Research on dropping out has shown that the decision
to persist in or leave school is affected by multiple contextual factors—
family, school, neighborhood, peers—interacting in a cumulative way over
the life course of a student.’ This suggests a daunting task for dealing with
the problem of dropout—if so many factors are involved in the decision
to drop out of school, including experiences outside of school and in early
grades, how can any high school effort substantially address the problem?

What is often lost in discussions about dropping out is the one factor
that is most directly related to graduation—students’ performance in their
courses. In Chicago, we have shown that inadequate credit accumulation
in the freshman year, which usually results from course failures, is highly
predictive of failing to graduate four years later. Research in New York City
has shown very similar connections between inadequate credit accumula-
tion and eventual dropping out, and national data confirms this; almost

all students who drop out leave school far behind in course credits.? As we

CONSORTIUM ON CHICAGO SCHOOL RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO



--- Page 21 ---
document here in more detail, success in high school
coursework is directly tied to eventual graduation.
Knowing that graduation is directly tied with course
grades suggests two potential strategies for address-
ing dropout problems. At the very least, we can use
freshman course performance to identify students at
high risk of dropping out to target with support and
intervention. At the most, if schools and teachers can
influence the quality of students’ performance in their
coursework, then they have a direct lever to affect
graduation rates—a lever that should simultaneously
improve student achievement.

In this report, we look closely at students’ perfor-
mance in their coursework during their freshman
year, how it is related to eventual graduation, and
how personal and school factors contribute to success
or failure in freshman-year courses. We show that
data on course performance can be used to identify
future dropouts and graduates with precision, and
we compare performance indicators to discern how
they might be used for nuanced targeting of students
at-risk of dropping out. We examine the factors that
contribute to course performance in the freshman year,
showing that success in coursework is affected more by
what students do while they are in high school than
by their preparation for high school and backgrounds.
Finally, we provide evidence that teachers and schools
matter for how students perform in their courses, and
that efforts to reduce dropout rates are consistent with
initiatives to address low achievement.

We focus on the freshman year because our prior
work, and work by others, has shown that course

6 Research in Philadelphia has also shown that course performance
in the eighth and ninth grades can be used to identify dropouts
years before they leave school (see work by Robert Balfanz, Ruth
Curran Neild, and Lisa Herzog). For example, using detailed records
on students, Neild and Balfanz (2005) used attendance and failure
in the eighth and ninth grades to identify dropouts in Philadelphia.
As in Chicago, they found that test scores were not as predictive of
graduation as students’ performance in their coursework.

performance in the freshman year sets the stage for
eventual graduation. This report builds on a report
we released June 2005 that described and defined
the “freshman on-track indicator.” In that report, we
showed the relationship between being on-track at the
end of the freshman year and graduating from high
school four and five years later. On-track students had
at least ten semester credits (five full-year course credits)
and no more than one semester F in a core course by
the end of their first year in high school. Students who
were on-track at the end of their freshman year were
nearly four times more likely to graduate from high
school than their classmates who were not on-track.°
The original on-track report provided initial evi-
dence that we could use freshman-year course perfor-
mance to precisely identify future dropouts. While it
was a key validation of the on-track indicator, it left a
number of unanswered questions: Why is the indica-
tor predictive? Why are students off-track? And what
might high schools themselves contribute to students’
course performance? Furthermore, that report only
examined whether students were making minimal
progress in their freshman year, which meant whether
they were earning sufficient credits to be on-track for
promotion to the tenth grade. But we want students to
graduate from high school ready for college and work,
which means we should aim for students doing A and
B quality work.’ In this report, we pull apart a variety
of indicators of freshman course performance—includ-
ing students’ failures, absences, and overall grades—to
learn what matters for a successful freshman year.

7 As documented in the CCSR report, From high school to the future:
A first look at CPS graduates college enrollment, college preparation, and
graduation from four-year colleges, students with a GPA lower than a
2.0 are unlikely to enroll in college, and those with a GPA lower than
3.0 are unlikely to obtain a four-year degree. Grades are also very
predictive of future earnings (Miller, 1998).

Chapter l

A Close Look at Course Grades, Failures,

and Absences in the Freshman Year

A: measure of minimally adequate performance, the on-track indicator
groups together marginally successful students and very successful
ones. Knowing that the on- and off-track groups both contain students with
widely differing course performances, we decided to explore what aspects of
being off-track made students less likely to graduate, and if more nuanced
indicators of course performance—such as number of course failures, GPA,
or absences—might be better predictors of eventual graduation. We begin
this chapter by examining these other indicators of course performance as
predictors of graduation. We then use the other indicators to look more closely

at what it means to be off-track.

A Number of Freshman-Year Indicators Can Be Used to Predict
High School Graduation

The on-track indicator is highly predictive of graduation, but it is a blunt
indicator; and the requisite data to construct the indicator are not available
until the end of a student’s first year in high school. Schools and districts
often ask if there are other indicators that could be used to forecast graduation.
In fact, there are several related measures of how well students do during
their freshman year that are equally predictive and more readily available,
including freshman-year GPA, the number of semester course failures, and

freshman-year absences.

Freshman Course Performance Among CPS Students

This report analyzes several different, but related,
indicators of freshman-year performance. Each is
defined below, along with summary figures that
show the performance of first-time ninth-graders in
the 2004—05 school year (24,894 students). We in-
clude only students who remained in school through
spring of their freshman year.

The 2005 report on the on-track indicator showed
that freshman-year course performance has improved
over the last decade in CPS; on-track rates improved
from 50 percent with the 1994—95 freshman class
to 60 percent with the 2003-04 class (excluding
first-year dropouts), while freshman-course pass rates
improved from 76 to 81 percent over the same
period.“ However, as detailed below, one cannot
escape the conclusion that, in general, freshmen in
CPS still do very poorly; more than half of fresh-
men fail a course, the average GPA is below a C, and
absence rates are very high—40 percent of freshmen
miss more than four weeks of school (including class
cutting). The statistics would sound even worse if we
included freshmen dropouts in the calculations. For
many students, freshman year is like a bottleneck—
their performance is so poor that they are unable to
recover. These negative experiences in freshman year
put students at high risk of not graduating, which
later prevents them from participating in the main-
stream economy and larger society. We cannot hope
to substantially improve graduation rates unless we
substantially improve students’ course performance
in their freshman year.

On-Track: A student is considered on-track if he or
she has accumulated five full credits (ten semester
credits) and has no more than one semester F in a
core subject (English, math, science, or social sci-
ence) by the end of the first year in high school.
This is an indicator of the minimal expected level
of performance. Students in CPS need 24 credits to
graduate from high school, so a student with only 5
credits at the end of freshman year will need to pass
courses at a faster rate in later years. The definition

MS )=6 [ ea

is aligned with the CPS promotion policy for moving
from freshman to sophomore year, which only requires
five full credits. In the 2004—05 freshman class, 59
percent of first-time high school students were on-track
while 41 percent were off-track (excluding students

who dropped out before the end of their first year in
high school).

Number of Semester Course Failures: In this report, we
measure failures across all courses by semester. This
differs from the on-track indicator, which only incor-
porates failures in core subjects (reading, math, science,
and social science); this report examines overall course
performance, not just performance in core courses. A
typical student takes 7 courses each semester; thus, a
typical student could fail as many as 14 courses in a
year. Figure 1 graphs the number of semester courses
failed by first-time freshmen in the 2004—05 school
year, excluding students who dropped out before the
end of their first year in high school. The modal cat-
egory of failures is 0; however, more than half the CPS
freshmen (53 percent) fail at least one course.

Grade Point Average (GPA): CPS students receive a
weighted GPA on their report card, which gives extra
points for grades in honors and Advanced Placement
(AP) courses. In this report, we analyze unweighted
GPAs (which use values of 4 points for an A, 3 fora B,
2 fora C, 1 fora D, and 0 for an F) for all credit-bear-
ing classes. We analyze unweighted GPAs rather than
weighted GPAs because all students do not have equal
access to honors, International Baccalaureate (IB), and
AP courses. Figure 2 shows the distribution of GPAs
among first-time freshmen in 2004—05, for students
who remained in school through spring term. A 2.0
GPA (C average) is typical for CPS freshmen. Very
few students—only 3 percent—have A averages their
freshman year, while more than 40 percent of freshmen
finish the year with a GPA lower than 2.0 (a D+ aver-
age or lower). About a quarter of students have a B or
higher average at the end of their freshman year.

Course Absences: Absences are counted on a course-
by-course basis and then aggregated into total
number of days absent. If a student misses one out
of seven courses in a day, it counts as one-seventh
of a day of absence for that student. Figure 3 shows
absence rates for students entering CPS high schools
in the 2004—05 school year, excluding students
who dropped out before the end of their first year
in high school. One-quarter of students missed less
than one week of school per semester. Forty percent
of students missed more than two weeks of school
per semester, which is a month or more of class time
per year. There are 90 days in each semester, so
these students missed more than 10 percent of the
annual instructional time. Students can be counted
as truant with 20 unexcused full-day absences.

Table 1 shows how well each of the four indicators
of freshman-year course performance predicts whether
students will graduate from high school within four
years. Whether a student is on-track, GPA, and the
number of semester course failures all correctly identify
graduates and nongraduates 80 percent of the time.
GPA is the most accurate for identifying nongradu-
ates. Freshman-year absences are slightly less predic-
tive than the other three indicators because they do
not distinguish students who are attending school but
performing poorly in their classes from those who are
attending and performing well. Although the four
indicators of course performance may seem somewhat
interchangeable, they each provide somewhat different
information, as described below.

In the earlier report, we showed that students on-
track at the end of their freshman year are about four
times more likely to graduate than off-track students
(see Figure 4). The on-track indicator has advantages
over the other indicators in terms of ease of reporting
and being easily understood by a broad public. Because
it isa categorical variable with only two values—either
on- or off-track—it is easy to report trends over time.
However, the on-track indicator does not provide infor-
mation that is precise enough to allow specific students
to be targeted for specific interventions. In addition,
the indicator does not provide timely information to
schools: it cannot be calculated until the summer after
students’ first year of high school.

Several researchers have found that high absence
rates are strong predictors of dropping out.! In CPS,
about 15 percent of first-time freshmen have extremely

high absence rates, missing one month or more of
classes each semester (see Figure 3). These students
have largely disengaged from school—they remain
enrolled, but have marginal attendance—and they have
less than a 10 percent chance of graduating (see Figure
5). However, it is not just extremely low attendance
that is problematic. Even moderate levels of absences are
a cause for concern. Just one to two weeks of absence
per semester, which are typical for CPS freshmen, are
associated with a substantially reduced probability of
graduating. In the 2000-01 cohort, only 63 percent
of students who missed about one week (five to nine
days) graduated in four years, compared to 87 percent
of those who missed less than one week. This is of
great concern, considering that only one-quarter of
CPS freshmen miss less than one week of school per
semester. Attendance is clearly a vital part of graduating
from high school, but beyond this we show evidence
later in this report that attendance is the most essential
requirement for avoiding course failure.

Information on absences is available early in the
school year and might be the most practical indicator
for identifying students for early interventions. More
than half the nongraduates can be identified by the
end of the first semester using either absence or failure
rates. By the end of the first term, course grades and
failure rates are slightly better predictors of graduation
than attendance because they directly indicate whether
students are making progress in their courses. These
rates also provide more specific information to target
programs for struggling students than the on-track
indicator. GPA, in particular, provides information
about who is likely to struggle in later years and is the
best indicator for predicting nongraduates.? As shown
in Figure 6, students with a 2.5 GPA (C+ average)
in their freshman year have a very high likelihood of
graduating within four years—86 percent did so in the
2000-01 freshman cohort. As grades fall between 2.0
(C average) and 0.5 (D- average), graduation rates fall
dramatically. Just under three-fourths of students with
a 2.0 (C average) graduated by 2004 in the 2000-01
cohort, compared to about one-quarter of students
with a 1.0 (D average). Virtually no student with an
average lower than a D in the freshman year earned a
CPS diploma; this is a cause for concern, given that 15

percent of CPS students finished their freshman year
with lower than a D average (see Figure 2).

On the other hand, students with good grades in
their first year are very likely to be successful in their
remaining years of high school. In the 2000-01 enter-
ing class, almost all students with a B average or higher
at the end of their freshman year graduated within four
years. Furthermore, almost 80 percent of these students
graduated with a final GPA of 3.0 or higher. We know
from research that the decision to drop out is affected
by myriad factors in students’ lives, many of which exist
outside of the school.? It is probable that first-year stu-
dents who earned high grades experienced fewer outside
stressors than other students, and fewer personal and
home problems undoubtedly made graduating from
high school easier for them. However, it is also likely
that many of the students who received good grades

their freshman year also struggled with problems
outside of school sometime during their four years of
high school. Remember from Figure 2 that almost a
quarter of CPS freshmen have B or higher averages in
a district that is about 90 percent low income—thus,
most students with B or higher averages are low-income
students. Still, 95 percent of the students with B or
higher averages graduated within four years.4 Success
in the freshman year may make it easier for students
to continue, despite personal and family problems that
might develop during the course of high school.
Clearly, GPAs are related to course failures because
failures are part of the calculation of students’ GPAs.
Course failures are more directly tied to graduation,
however, because students need to accumulate a specific
number of course credits to receive a diploma, and
they must pass their classes to obtain credits. This is

Students’ Freshman-Year Course Performance Is Much More Important for Graduation Than
Their Background Characteristics and Prior Achievement

Students’ likelihood of graduation is affected by
their educational experiences prior to high school,
and is related to their economic and demographic
backgrounds. Research on graduation has shown
particularly strong relationships of graduation
with students’ test scores and age on entry into
high school—which is a proxy for grade retention.
Graduation is also related to students’ gender, race,
and economic status. However, all of these factors to-
gether explain only about 12 percent of the variation
in graduation rates in the cohort of students entering
CPS high schools in the 2000-01 school year.8 In

contrast, students’ freshman-year GPA and number
of Fs explain 39 percent of the variation in gradua-
tion rates.© Once we know how students performed
in their classes in their freshman year, additional
information about their backgrounds does little to
improve our prediction of whether they will gradu-
ate. P As we showed in Table 1, ninth-grade Fs or
GPA each can be used to predict about 80 percent of
graduates; if we include information about students’
background characteristics and prior achievement,
we only improve the prediction by about half a
percentage point.

life-course that contribute to graduation/dropout. They reported
that ninth-grade performance, behaviors, and attitudes (GPA, grade
retention, parent attitudes, pupil behaviors, and pupil attitudes)
together explained 44.1 percent of the variation in dropout rates;
when they added in background factors, the variation explained
increased by just under 6 percent (to 49.8 percent).

reflected in the consistent relationship between the
number of courses a student fails and whether that
student eventually graduates, as shown in Figure 7.
Each additional course failure makes it more difficult
to graduate.” Once students have failed six semester
courses (i.e., three full-year courses), they are so un-
likely to graduate that additional failures only modestly
decrease the probability of graduating; these students
have failed half their courses or more.°

Because each indicator has different advantages, an
effective monitoring system could be created to take
advantage of each indicator at different points in the
school year. For example, because absence rates are
known early in the school year, schools could address
poor course attendance within the first quarter. After
students’ first-quarter grades are known, students with
failure warnings should receive immediate supports.
When semester grades are posted, those students
with failures will need a strategy for making up miss-
ing credits. At the end of the school year, students’
grades could be used to identify students at high risk
of future failure and to identify students performing
below their potential (e.g., students with high test scores
but low grades). On-track rates for the cohort could
be determined in the summer after the school year as
a simple indicator to evaluate school programs and
policies, and to identify particular groups of students
with nonpromotion rates that are especially high.

Course Failure Is a Sign that Students Are
Generally Struggling in School

Students can be off-track just by failing one yearlong
course (two semester courses). After writing the last
report, we wondered about the extent to which students
were thrown off-track by an aberrant course failure. We
also wondered if course failure was as detrimental to
graduation among students who were generally doing
well in their other courses as it was for students who
were struggling across all of their courses. To gain a
better understanding of the variability in the course
performance of on- and off-track students, and what
that variability means for graduation, we examine on-
and off-track performance by students’ failures and
their grades in the courses they passed.

In general, off-track students are struggling in all
of their courses. Figure 8 shows the distribution of
GPAs in passed courses by the number of semester
course failures. Even on-track students have relatively
low GPAs. Among students with no failures, the typical
GPA is about 2.5 (C+). Only half (48 percent) has a
GPA ofa B or higher; 23 percent are C or D+. Among
students with only one semester F, who are also on-
track by our definition, over 90 percent have a GPA
lower than 3.0 (B average) in the courses that they pass.
More than three-fourths of students who fail just one
full-year course have grades averaging 2.0 or lower (C
or lower) in the classes they pass. Almost all off-track
students who fail two or more semester courses have
GPAs of 2.0 or lower in the classes they pass. It is most
typical for off-track students to have a GPA of 1.5 (D+
average) in the courses they pass.

Few students experience isolated problems and
perform well in other coursework. Failure in even one
semester course is generally a sign of trouble in other
courses. This suggests that problems or successes in
one class may generalize to other classes. For example,
a student who skips one class may fail to show up to
subsequent classes that day. Likewise, success in one
class may lead a student to put forth more effort in other
classes. Of course, performance in all courses will be
affected by factors such as students’ background and
preparation, and by the overall instructional climate
of the school.

The strong connection between grades overall and
failures in a few classes has implications for how we
think about high school reform strategies. Instead of
being isolated, problems with course failure tend to in-
dicate broader problems of academic performance. This
suggests that strategies that address particular courses
(e.g., math remediation or tutoring) might be limited
in their ability to affect broader outcomes, compared
to more comprehensive strategies (e.g., instructional
coordination across classes or schoolwide attendance
initiatives). This also suggests problems of course
failures, dropping out, and low achievement should
be addressed by coordinated strategies. These issues
are discussed further as we explore the school factors
associated with freshman-year course performance.

Overall Grades, as Well as Failures,
Matter for Graduation

Course failures and overall GPA are strongly related.
However, among students with the same number of
Fs, higher grades in other courses increase the likelihood
of graduation. Figure 9 shows graduation rates classi-
fied by the number of Fs and GPA in the courses that
students passed. Each column represents students with
the same number of freshman-year failures. Among
students with the same number of failures, those who
had higher grades in the courses they passed were much
more likely to graduate. Even students with no failures
in their first year of high school were at some risk of
not graduating if they had a C average or lower. It is
likely that poor grades in the freshman year foreshadow
problems with course failure in later years. Students
who just barely pass their freshman classes are likely to
struggle as they move into their sophomore year.
Course grades predict the likelihood of graduating,
but course failures have a direct effect on gradua-
tion beyond their relationship with students’ overall
grades. Ultimately, students need course credits to

graduate; and failures have a direct effect on the
probability of graduating. As shown in Figure 9, the
probability of graduating declines quickly with each
additional course failure.’ This can be seen more
clearly in Figure 10, which shows graduation rates
by freshman GPA for both on- and off-track stu-
dents. All students with very low freshman GPAs are
off-track (see far left of graph), and nearly all students
with high GPAs are on-track (see far right of graph).
But in the middle range, GPAs from 1.0 to 2.5 (D to
C+), students can be either on- or off-track depending
on how many Fs they have. For students in this middle
range, about 60 percent of students, having failed more
than one semester course has a strong impact on the
likelihood of graduating. Among students with the
same overall GPA, on-track students are about 9 per-
centage points more likely to graduate than off-track
students with the same GPA. This occurs even though
off-track students must have had higher grades in their

passed courses than students with the same overall
GPA who are on-track.

FIGURE 10

Intervention Efforts Are Needed for More
Than Just the Lowest-Performing Students

Students with high rates of course failure are extremely
unlikely to graduate. Those who fail four or more se-
mester courses (i.e., two courses in each semester), or
who hold lower than a D average, probably need very
intensive assistance in order to graduate; and schools
may be disappointed with the effects of programs that
are not sufficiently comprehensive. On the other hand,
students with GPAs in the D+ or C- range, or just one
failure in the first semester (two semester failures for
the year), are about as likely to graduate as not to
graduate. Because students in this GPA range con-
stitute a large percentage of students and they have
a reasonable chance of graduating, efforts to support
these students could have a substantial payoff for school
graduation rates. However, because such students are
not the lowest performers, these students may not be
seen as in great need of support.

To gauge the degree to which graduation rates might
be affected by a targeted effort to increase passing

rates, Figure 11 simulates the maximum improvements
in graduation rates that could be expected if schools
could find a way to get each student to pass two ad-
ditional semester courses (one full-year course) in their
freshman year. This could be considered a summer
school recovery effect, since students can take a full-
year course over the summer, or a potential effect of
increasing academic supports in the school year. To
estimate the effect, we simply assign each student the
graduation rate observed among students who had two
fewer failures than that student. This is an overestima-
tion of potential graduation rates, because we do not
consider other factors that are associated with failure
that influence graduation. However, it allows us to
gauge the relative effects of improvements in pass rates
on different groups of students.

The bottom of Figure 11 shows that about half the

Fs in their freshman year: 2,679 students who failed
to graduate had seven or more semester Fs in their
freshman year, and an additional 1,347 students who
failed to graduate had five or six semester Fs. Thus, this
may seem like a reasonable group to target for recov-
ery efforts or tutoring. However, improving pass rates
among these students by two semester courses would
do little to affect overall graduation rates—their prob-
ability of graduating is so small that they would still
be unlikely to graduate with an additional two course
credits. We might expect as many as 170 additional
graduates among students with seven or more semes-
ter failures (a 1 percentage point increase in the total
graduation rate), and as many as 308 more graduates
among students with five or six semester course failures
(a 2 percentage point increase in the total graduation
rate). Students with many course failures will need
more support than tutoring or summer school to have a
reasonable chance of graduating—all of these students

Number of Semester Course Failures

“Graduation rates for students failing fewer than two courses are estimated
as if they failed no courses. This simulation suggests the maximum degree
to which graduation rates could be expected to improve if each student failed
two fewer courses or recovered two courses immediately after failure. It is an
overestimation because it does not take into account factors other than Fs
that affect graduation (e.g., grades in passed courses tend to be lower among
students with more Fs). However, it can be used to gauge the relative effects

of recovery or improvements in pass rates for students with different rates of
failure. While students with multiple Fs comprise the majority of nongraduates,
small improvements in pass rates or recovery among these students would
have a much smaller effect on graduation rates than similar efforts among
students who have failed only one or two courses. These figures are based
on students in the 2000-01 freshman cohort.

What Matters for Staying On-Track and Graduating in Chicago Public High Schools


--- Page 32 ---
How We Obtained Information on Students and Schools

The analyses in this report are based on two cohorts
of students. The statistics that show freshman course
performance without any reference to graduation
rates or survey data are based on all freshmen who
entered CPS high schools in fall 2004 who did not
attend charter schools (24,894 students). Statistics
that tie freshman course performance to graduation
rates are based on all students who entered CPS high
schools in fall 2000 who did not transfer out of CPS
before September 2004 and who did not attend a
charter school (20,803 students).4 Statistics that
use survey data only include those students from the
2004-05 cohort who participated in the spring 2005
surveys (14,045 students) described below.

Data on students’ course absences and grades come
from semester-by-semester grade files provided by
the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Data on grades
and absences are provided separately for each course
taken by each student each semester. All CPS schools,
except charter schools, provide this information.
For this reason, charter school students cannot be
included in any of the analyses in this report.

Data on students’ background characteristics
and school demographics come from student admin-
istrative records and test score files provided by
CPS. Gender, race, and age are part of the adminis-
trative record files. Mobility, which is calculated from
longitudinal administrative records on individual
students, is measured as the number of times a stu-
dent changed schools in the three years prior to high
school. Eighth-grade achievement is measured with
students’ scores in the reading and math sections of
the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS).

Students’ socioeconomic status is measured
through two variables, which were constructed from
the 2000 U.S. census data, regarding the economic
conditions in students’ residential block groups. The
first, concentration of poverty, is constructed from
information on the male unemployment rate and
the percentage of families living below the poverty
line. The second, social status, is constructed from

information about average income and education
levels. These indicators allow for much more dis-
crimination in socioeconomic background than the
simple indicator of free/reduced lunch, for which
about 90 percent of CPS students are eligible.

Measures of school climate come from surveys
conducted by the Consortium on Chicago School
Research (CCSR) in spring 2005. Nearly 130,000
students, teachers, and principals across the system
participated. Our surveys ask about learning climate,
teacher-student relationships, leadership, and
quality of the school’s instructional program. They
also ask about the school’s professional environment,
and the nature of the school’s relationships with
parents and the community. From these surveys we
create measures about features of each school.®
Students’ perceptions of climate are constructed
from responses of ninth- and tenth-grade students.
Teachers’ perceptions are constructed from respons-
es of teachers at all grade levels.

Unfortunately, the data do not allow us to dis-
cern individual students’ specific experiences on
a class-by-class basis. For each measure, students
either reported on just one of their courses (English
or math) or on the school as a whole. We can ag-
gregate the data from all students to create measures
of climate across the school, and classroom climate
across English and math classes in the school, but we
cannot distinguish different patterns of experience
within the school among different students. Still,
these measures of the average climate in schools
provide some evidence about what matters for course
performance, although we would expect to find
stronger relationships if we could map out different
experiences within schools.

need to pass at least four additional semester courses
to be on-track, and many need much more. Modest
efforts to support these students will not be sufficient
to have a sizable impact on graduation rates.

On the other hand, summer school and tutoring
that is targeted at students with small numbers of
course failures could potentially have a sizable effect
on graduation rates. If students who failed just one or
two semester classes were to pass those classes instead

Freshman On-Track

What is Freshman On-Track?

Freshman On-Track % is a measure of how many first-time freshmen are, by the end of their first year, “on track” to graduate from
high school within four years. The measure is based on two freshman year data points: (i) credit accumulation; (ii) course failures.
An eligible first-year freshman is on-track by the end of the year if s/he has: (i) earned at least five course credits; (ii) failed no more
than one semester of a core course—otherwise, s/he is off track. CCSR research shows that freshmen who finish their first year of
high school on-track are more than three times as likely as those off-track to graduate from high school within four years.

There are a few technical points regarding FOT calculation that anyone using this data should be aware of:
e Eligible freshmen count towards the FOT rate of the school they attend on the 20" day of school, regardless of where they
finish, or spend the majority of, the school year.
e Freshman year dropouts are included in the metric, and they are counted as off-track.
e Freshmen attending the following types of schools (as of the 20" day) are not included in the metric:
o Charter schools
o Jail schools
o Alternative schools
o Special Ed schools
e Students repeating ninth grade are not included in the metric.

While attendance may impact whether a student earns the necessary amount of credits and/or passes courses, attendance does
not directly factor in to the calculation of this metric.

Components of Freshman On Track

e §Credits accumulated during first year of HS (>/= 5)
¢ Number of semester core course failures during first year of HS (</= 1)

How are results reported?

Annual
e  School-level Freshman On-Track data for the years 1997-2009 is currently available on the REA website. To obtain it, visit
the REA homepage, then navigate to School and Citywide Reports->All Schools, then look for the Excel file called
“Freshman On Track Rates” under the heading On Track Rates, 1997-2009.
e  Student-level Freshman On-Track data—which is aggregated up to the school, area and district levels for reporting and
accountability purposes—is not available directly via website. However, it can be obtained on an as-needed basis by
contacting Daisy Garcia (x32367) or Melva Ryan (x32536) of Central Office PM.

Point-in-time

A “point in time” Freshman On-Track rate—a rough approximation of end-of-year Freshman On-Track rate—is also available, on a
dynamically updated basis, via the Freshman Success Report located on Dashboard. This point-in-time rate may be useful to
monitor and manage school and area performance within the school year: be advised, however, that the value of this rate jumps
around quite a bit during the school year, is always lower at the end than the beginning of the year, and is based on an
approximation of the end-of-year FOT criteria. Any questions regarding Dashboard data should be directed to John DiCello,
Dashboard Manager, at x31669.

What questions can Freshman On-Track data answer?

Freshman On-Track data can be used at the aggregate level—whether district, area or school—to gauge what percentage of
students are “on track” to graduate in four years—in turn, we know that students who are on-track after freshman year are over
three times as likely as those off-track to graduate in four years. In short, it helps us answer the broad question: “How good of a
job is this part of the district doing making sure its freshmen have attained the education they need to graduate on time?”



--- Page 36 ---
Freshman On-Track data can also be cut in numerous ways to indicate how successful schools, areas, or the district as a whole have
been at intervening with “at risk” students to ensure they are on pace to graduate on time. Interesting analytical questions and
possible deep dives include:

e What % of students who were flagged on the beginning-of-year Freshman Watchlist (or any of the quarterly Freshman
Success Reports) finished the year “On Track”?

e =What kinds of “at risk” students are we most (and least) successful at getting on track—kids with attendance problems?
Academic problems? Both?

e How do different racial/demographic groups break down in terms of Freshman On-Track %, and how (if at all) should this
information inform school- and/or classroom-level FOT strategies?

e Did tailored, school-level interventions “work”?—How much more likely were “at risk” students who received particular
types of intervention (e.g. tutoring, parent conferences, etc.) during their first year of high school to be “on track” than
those who did not?

e Among our off-track students, what particular classes or subject areas are causing the most semester failures? Do we
have a plan to ensure that proper supports are in place to help reduce failure rates in these areas going forward?

e Among a high school’s freshman student body, are there substantial variations/patterns depending on what elementary
feeder school a student attended, and how should this impact our feeder school outreach strategy?

@ What percentage of our off-track freshmen graudate within four years?—and do we have effective credit recovery
programs in place to get these kids back on track during sophomore/junior/senior year?

@ What percentage of our on-track freshmen graduate within four years?—and do we have effective
sophomore/junior/senior year transition programs in place to ensure that on-track kids stay on track?

What questions can Freshman On-Track data NOT answer?

@ Freshman On-Track was designed to be predictive of high school graduation—NOT of either college enrollment or college
success. Standardized test scores and GPAs are much better indicators of the latter.
@ Freshman On-Track will tell us how many of a given school’s freshmen were on track, but not how close a given student or
given student was to the FOT “cutoffs” —i.e. it will NOT tell us:
o How many more credits/fewer failures off-track students needed to be on-track
o How far beyond “On Track” baseline cutoffs on-track students were, in terms of credit accumulation
e Without deeper analysis, FOT will not indicate why a student was off-track, i.e. whether it was because s/he did not
attempt enough credits, or because s/he did not pass enough credits.
e FOT cannot directly answer any questions about student attendance, nor does it incorporate such data.
e ~=FOT will not tell you anything about what happens to students who have been retained, i.e. are second-time freshmen.
e = Also, keep in mind that FOT rates are highly dependent on:
o Ability level and work habits of incoming students
o Grading policies at individual high schools



--- Page 37 ---
How is Freshman On-Track data used within CPS?

Freshman On-Track data is a key self-monitoring tool for schools, which can be used to help gauge the effectiveness of school-
specific intervention and transition strategies for g'" graders.

It is also a key district accountability metric, in two ways:

1. First, the metric % of Freshmen On-Track appears on the districtwide annual high school scorecard, which is used to gauge
CAO effectiveness and progress towards district and area goals.

2. Second, FOT is a crucial component of the district’s Performance Policy, which dictates whether or not a given school is on
probation. Specifically, a high school can earn up to three (3) points for its current FOT level, and up to (3) points for its
FOT trend—six (6) points, total. For more specific information on how FOT counts towards probation status, please visit
http://policy.cps.k12.il.us/documents/302.6.pdf.

Where can I find more information?

e Several online resources from the REA website explain the methodology behind Freshman On Track and the ways in which
CPS uses this data centrally.

e A Freshman On-Track Handbook, which details the experiences of six Freshman On-Track “lab” schools while developing
and implementing, is available from Paige Ponder of Graduation Pathways (paponder@cps.k12.il.us; x32078).

e Areport from CCSR (Chicago Consortium on School Research) describing the development and predictive validity of this
metric is available online at http://ccsr.uchicago.edu/publications/07%20What%20Matters%20Final.pdf.

e Peter Godard (prgodard@cps.k12.il.us; x32735) and Michael Deuser (xmkdeuser@cps.k12.il.us; x31278) can help explain
what the metric measures and how it is calculated.

Purpose

Building relationships with students is a critical lever for supporting them in
the transition to high school. Structures such as mentoring and Freshman
Advisory programs allow students to receive on-time and targeted support
through one-on-one, small group, and/or whole group activities. During the
initial phases, Success Teams may struggle when deciding what interventions
will be the most impactful for their students. Tool Set B provides you with a
collection of practical, research-based articles to increase your knowledge of
meaningful and targeted student interventions.

How & When to Use

Professional readings provide a common learning experience for your Success
Team. Using a text-based protocol with the professional reading allows partic-
ipants to process new information as well as discuss implications for practice.
The Network for College Success finds protocols to be very helpful for struc-
turing an efficient and productive conversation when in teams. Some possible
protocols for use with these articles are the Four A’s Text Protocol, The Final
Word and Text-Based Seminar.

The Developmental
Relationships Framework

This Framework, produced by the Search Institute, has identified five
elements—expressed in 20 specific actions—that make relationships
powerful in young people’s lives. Educators must build relationships
with freshmen so they can successfully navigate the transition to
high school. These relationships not only support students in the
classroom, but can help them discover who they are in the world.

The Developmental Relationships Framework

Young people are more likely to grow up successfully when they experience developmental relationships with
important people in their lives. Developmental relationships are close connections through which young people
discover who they are, cultivate abilities to shape their own lives, and learn how to engage with and contribute
to the world around them. Search Institute has identified five elements—expressed in 20 specific actions—that
make relationships powerful in young people’s lives.

Relationships across the School Year

Goals
¢« Plan for successful re-entry of a 9th-grade student into the classroom community

¢ Collect qualitative data that can inform Freshman Success team efforts across the school year

Introduction

During Q3 of the 2021-22 academic year, NCS partner schools ideated a change idea to address
the challenge of welcoming a student who has experienced any number of absences back to the
classroom community.

This protocol provides a step-by-step framework to have a supportive, asset-framed conversation
with students instead. Given that attendance also heavily influences Freshman On-Track, this
protocol can be invaluable to improving FOT in any given school context.

The Search Institute’s Developmental Relationships Framework provides the foundational
components that inform specific teacher moves. Additionally, this protocol models how using all
five Developmental Relationships components together can intentionally and supportively ease a
student’s transition back into the classroom after one or more absences.

Acknowledgment

This classroom tool was created due to the work from NCS’s 2021-22 Freshman Success
Improvement Community, particularly the impactful work at Englewood STEM High School.

Potential Next Steps
¢ If needed, create a follow-up action plan in partnership with the student and student supports
¢ Communicate progress with Freshman Success Team

Purpose

One responsibility of the Success Team is to develop and track interventions.
Team members should give thoughtful consideration to design to ensure that
interventions are meeting the needs of all students, including those who are
underperforming and those who are high achieving. The team must also
determine the effectiveness of interventions and their impact on student
achievement.

How & When to Use

Planning effective student interventions can be a challenging task for both new
and established Success Teams. This set of tools provides support for teams
that are creating and/or fine-tuning their student intervention systems by
encouraging teams to describe, analyze, and reflect on their current practices.
Furthermore, these tools provide team members with opportunities to adjust
interventions to better serve students.

Considerations When Planning
Tier 2 Interventions

For information on the tiered systems of student support, please refer to the RT| Action Network.

Data Questions

To what degree is attendance playing a role in student performance? To whom do you refer Tier 3
students who have serious attendance issues (inside and outside of the school) so that the
Success Team can really concentrate on supporting Tier 2 students?

How does the grade distribution look by teacher? Are there teachers who are failing a dispropor-
tionate number of students?

Do your assessment policies create opportunities for students to demonstrate mastery, or do they
cause students to feel overwhelmed and fall off track?

Targeting Students

¢ How many students have you identified for Success Team intervention? Does this number fall in
the 15 - 25% range for Tier 2 supports? Are there students who are really Tier 3 being included
into Tier 2 supports?

Intervention Selection
« What issue is the intervention addressing? (academic/social-emotional/behavioral)

¢ What programs/resources already exist in the building that could possibly address the issue? How
closely do these programs/resources align with the identified needs of students? For example, if
tutoring is being offered already, is it designed to help students with real-time issues they face in
their classes or is it specifically designed for remediation of basic skills?

Intervention Implementation

¢ Who will implement the intervention?

¢ Who will coordinate the intervention (logistics)?

¢ Who will own the tracking of the intervention’s effectiveness?

« What does successful implementation look like?

Tracking Effectiveness

¢ Does tracking your intervention include the following information: targeted students’ names,
participation (such as the number of times targeted students participate within a specified
period), grade check dates, and grades in targeted courses?

¢ Does your tracking tool allow you to aggregate point-in-time data in different ways so that you
can accurately monitor targeted student progress?

¢ What is your timeline for course correction?

Quick Guide to Tracking Interventions

Tracking is necessary to determine the efficacy of an intervention so that adjustments can be made
in a timely manner. A tracking tool is more effective when it is in a teacher-friendly format that can
be disaggregated to pull data for specific subgroups. For example, if your team is using tutoring as
an intervention, and the targeted student group requires tutoring in more than one core class, your
tracking tool should be able to disaggregate data to ascertain intervention impact by course. Micro-
soft Excel and Google Sheets can support the tracking of interventions by disaggregating data and
creating graphs.

Features of Good Intervention Tracking Tools

« Name of the intervention and what key performance indicator it addresses (attendance,
point-in-time On-Track rates, GPA, behavior metric, etc.)

¢ Names of the targeted students
° If tracking grades, include each core course’s average expressed as a percentage
* Intervention contacts/implementation evidence
° Tutoring attendance
° Mentorship contact dates
° “Office hours” visits
¢ Point-in-time progress on the key performance indicator impacted by the intervention
° Should include at least 2 checkpoints within a 10-week period
° If tracking grades, provide an average expressed as a percentage for each core course

° If tracking attendance, provide number of cumulative absences and/or tardies

these reports every five weeks. BAG Reports use real-time data so
students understand where and how they are struggling, and which
educators they may need to reach out to for support. They also help
students understand their current status in relation to their goals.
Schools can use BAG Reports in different ways, including individual
conversations with students or holding “town hall” meetings for all
freshmen to review the data and set next steps.

STUDENT BRIEF

Freshman Year: [he Make-it or Break-it Year

You are about to start the most important year of high school—perhaps the most
important year of school so far. This is the year that will set the stage for whether
you will graduate and whether you will be ready for college.

How do we know this? Because researchers at the University of Chicago—the Consortium on Chicago
School Research—have spent years trying to understand what really matters when it comes to graduating
from Chicago Public Schools. Working in cooperation with the district, the Consortium researchers have
analyzed years of data—surveys, standardized tests, student grades, attendance records—and uncovered
some connections that might surprise you.

It’s not about your 8" grade test scores, or even the ACT test that you will face in the 11" grade, although
these tests do matter. It’s not about where you live and how much money your family earns, although
those facts get a lot of attention when educators talk about drop-out statistics.

Here’s what really matters far more than anything: GRADES AND ATTENDANCE.

No one wants to be a drop-out statistic. So as you Freshman Grades Predict Graduation
begin this crucial year, consider what research tells soos a7% 98%

What does all this research mean for students?

Essentially, that the freshman year is an important
chance for a fresh start. Strong students can quickly
fall off course if they start cutting classes and blow-
ing off homework. And students who struggled in
elementary school can turn things around if they
come to school every day and aim for a B average.
For Chicago students who want to graduate from
college—and 78 percent of seniors say they do—that
B average in high school is what it’s going to take to
succeed in college.

So...what can you do?

V Get to school on time and don’t cut classes. You may
think it doesn’t matter to blow off your first or
last class of the day, but it does. Even occasional
skipping leads to dramatically lower grades. And
it sends the wrong message to teachers about your
desire to succeed.

V Ask your teachers for help. Teachers should be
helping struggling students, but sometimes it falls
on you to ask for help. We know from our research
that students do better in their courses when
they trust their teachers and count on them for
support.

It sounds simple, but there is a lot of room for
improvement in these two areas. That’s because:

¢ More than half of Chicago freshmen fail a course.

¢ About 40 percent miss more than a month of school
in that first year (which includes class cutting).

¢ The average GPA is lower than a “C.”

But you don’t have to be one of these statistics.

V Make academics your top priority. This means trying
hard on assignments even when they aren’t inter-
esting and choosing to study instead of socializing
when there is a big test. Students with good study
habits have higher GPAs and fail fewer courses
than classmates who don’t make homework a
priority.

Freshman Year: [he Make-it or Break-it Year

Your student is about to start the most important year of high school—perhaps
the most important year of school so far. This is the year that will set the stage for
whether they will graduate and whether they will be ready for college.

How do we know this? Because researchers at the University of Chicago--the Consortium for Chicago
School Research--have spent years trying to understand what really matters when it comes to graduating
from Chicago Public Schools. Working in cooperation with the district, the Consortium researchers have
analyzed years of data—surveys, standardized tests, student grades, attendance records—and uncovered
some connections that might surprise you.

It’s not about their 8" grade test scores, or even the ACT test they will face in the 11" grade, although

So...what can you do?

V Reinforce the importance of getting to school on time
and not cutting classes. Your teenager may think
it doesn’t matter to blow off the first or last class
of the day, but it does. Even occasional skipping
leads to dramatically lower grades. And it sends
the wrong message to teachers about the desire
to succeed.

Talk with your student’s teachers about how you
can help your teen succeed, especially if you see
his or her grades start to fall. Teachers should be
helping struggling students, but sometimes it falls
on freshmen (and their parents) to ask for that
help. We know from our research that students do

improvement in these two areas. That’s because:

¢ More than half of Chicago freshmen fail a course.

¢ About 40 percent miss more than a month of school
in that first year (which includes class cutting).

e The average GPA is lower than a “C.”

better in their courses when they trust their
teachers and count on them for support.
Communication with teachers is important,
especially if there are personal issues affecting
performance in class.

V Make academics your top priority for your freshman.
This means trying hard on assignments even
when they aren't interesting and choosing to
study instead of socializing when there is a big
test. Students with good study habits have higher
GPAs and fail fewer courses than classmates who
don’t make homework a priority.

Contents Purpose

Annotated Bibliography The relationship between freshman course performance and high school

of the UChicago graduation has been validated in schools, districts, cities, and states across

Consortium’s Research America. Since the release of the What Matters report, UChicago Consortium

on the Transition to researchers have produced a plethora of new evidence on the transition to

High School high school. This body of research is moving the field from mitigating course
failure (just staying On-Track) to supporting high levels of course performance

Developing the Risk and for all students. Specifically, this means helping students increase their Grade

Opportunity Framework Point Averages so they are ready for the rigors of college. Tool Set E provides

educators with an understanding of how the work has evolved in Chicago since
the development of the On-Track indicator.

How & When to Use

These tools can serve as reference guides when your school is ready to work
on improving course performance more holistically. The Annotated Biblio-
graphy lists and summarizes the key research coming out of the UChicago
Consortium on the transition to high school. It shows the scope of the work
from 2005, when the relationship between On-Track and high graduation rates
was identified, to the latest research in 2016. The Developing the Risk and
Opportunity Framework slide deck describes how the research indicators

and data analysis on freshman success evolved over time to become a more
complex early warning indicator system.

The On-Track Indicator as a Predictor of High School Graduation

JUNE, 2005
Elaine M. Allensworth and John Q. Easton

This research brief identifies the relationship between ninth grade course performance and high
school graduation for the first time in UChicago Consortium research.

What Matters for Staying On-Track and Graduating in Chicago Public High Schools

JULY, 2007
Elaine M. Allensworth and John Q. Easton

This report is the foundational text for On-Track work in Chicago. What Matters deepened research-
ers’ and practitioners’ understanding of the relationship between ninth grade and high school
graduation by making connections between Freshman On-Track, absence rates, and the culture
and climate of Chicago’s high schools. The report also challenged the idea that students’ academic
skill level—as measured by achievement tests—was their biggest barrier to success in high school.
Instead, the report suggested practitioners focus on boosting student attendance, increasing class-
room engagement, and building stronger student-teacher relationships as strategies for increasing
freshman course performance. Ultimately, the report hypothesized that supporting freshmen would
lead to increased graduation rates.

What Matters for Staying On-Track and Graduating in Chicago Public Schools:
A Focus on Students with Disabilities

DECEMBER, 2009
Julia Gwynne, Joy Lesnick, Holly Hart, and Elaine M. Allensworth

This report examines whether or not On-Track is an effective early warning indicator for students
with disabilities in Chicago. The authors found that freshman year course performance—more than
background characteristics such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, or prior achievement—pre-
dicts which students with disabilities are most at risk for dropping out of high school. This means
that, while the work of keeping freshman with disabilities On Track to Graduate may be difficult, it is
still the right strategy for increasing graduation rates among this particularly vulnerable sub-group
of students in Chicago Public Schools.

What Matters for Staying On-Track and Graduating in Chicago Public Schools:
A Focus on English Language Learners

MAY, 2012
Julia Gwynne, Amber Stitziel Pareja, Stacy B. Ehrlich, and Elaine M. Allensworth

This report examines whether or not On-Track was an effective early warning indicator for English
Language Learner (ELL) students in Chicago. The authors found that course performance indica-
tors are highly predictive of graduation for ELL students. In fact, course performance is more pre-
dictive than other ELL-specific indicators, including English language proficiency level and whether
students experienced interruptions in their education. This means that, while the work of keeping
ELL students On Track to Graduate may be difficult, it is still the right strategy for increasing gradu-
ation rates among this particularly vulnerable sub-group of students in Chicago Public Schools.

Teaching Adolescents to Become Learners: The Role of Noncognitive Factors in
Shaping School Performance

JUNE, 2012
Camille A. Farrington, Melissa Roderick, Elaine M. Allensworth, Jenny Nagaoka, Tasha Seneca Keyes,
David W. Johnson, and Nicole O. Beechum

This literature review was the beginning of a new line of work at the UChicago Consortium to
understand noncognitive factors and how those factors shape students’ success in school. Non-
cognitive factors can be habits and mindsets like belonging, academic perseverance, study habits,
self-regulation, and many others. This work called attention to the idea that skills and habits can

be shaped in schools, particularly in the classroom, and pushed educators to explicitly incorporate
these factors into the ongoing work of teaching and learning. Noncognitive factors can offer practi-
tioners a new way of seeing the On-Track work from a student’s perspective and shed new light on
freshman success. Rather than just focusing on student attendance and work, this review encourag-
es educators to think about shaping students’ mindsets as learners to make a successful transition
into high school.

Preventable Failure: Improvements in Long-Term Outcomes When High Schools
Focused on the Ninth Grade Year: Research Summary

APRIL, 2014
Melissa Roderick, Thomas Kelley-Kemple, David W. Johnson, and Nicole O. Beechum

What happens to graduation rates as On-Track rates rise? After many years of strong improvement
in On-Track rates across Chicago’s schools, UChicago Consortium researchers re-evaluated the
relationship between the On-Track indicator and graduation. The authors found that schools that
experienced substantial increases in On-Track rates also saw increases in graduation rates. In
addition, On-Track increases paid off for all kinds of students in all kinds of schools, with African-
American and Latino males—those who had the lowest On-Track rates to begin with—making the
greatest gains. This research gave practitioners in Chicago confidence that the focus on ninth grade
is the right focus for high school improvement.

Free to Fail or On-Track to College Series

SEPTEMBER, 2014
W. David Stevens, Elaine M. Allensworth, Amber Stitziel Pareja, Marisa de la Torre, Julia A. Gwynne,
Todd Rosenkranz, and James Sebastian

This series comprises three short reports:

¢ An Introduction to the UChicago CCSR Research Series
« Why Grades Drop When Students Enter High School and What Adults Can Do About It
¢« Setting the Stage for Academic Challenge: Classroom Control and Student Support

The Free to Fail or On-Track to College series uses qualitative data from student interviews—in
addition to the UChicago Consortium’s quantitative data archive—to help illustrate new and on-
going challenges students face in the transition to high school. Among other important findings,
this work identifies the enormous scope of talent loss between eighth and ninth grade in Chicago
Public Schools, even among high-achieving students. These reports draw attention to the decrease
in ninth grade course performance generally as well as the more specific problem of students who
earn As and Bs in eighth grade but only Cs and Ds in ninth grade. Low course performance pushes
students off the path to college readiness in the same way that course failure pushes students off
the path to high school graduation.

Looking Forward to High School and College: Middle Grade Indicators of Readiness
in Chicago Public Schools

NOVEMBER, 2014
Elaine M. Allensworth, Julia A. Gwynne, Paul Moore, and Marisa de la Torre

When released, this report helped Chicago practitioners make a shift from thinking about On-Track
work as a way to mitigate course failure and increase high school graduation to envisioning a more
holistic approach to supporting freshman success and ensuring that students are ready to succeed
in college. UChicago Consortium researchers re-investigated the foundational relationship between
students’ academic performance in the middle grades and their performance in high school, and
once again reinforced the importance of ninth grade as an inflection point in students’ academic
trajectories. The report also added important pieces of evidence to the body of research, such as
the use of eighth grade attendance and GPA as indicators of high school readiness and the surpris-
ingly low rate of academically talented eighth graders going on to earn B averages in high school.
This research provides the evidence behind the “Risk and Opportunity” Framework that is now used
by the Network for College Success and schools across the city as a robust early warning indicator
system in the transition to high school.

Foundations for Young Adult Success: A Developmental Framework

Jenny Nagaoka, Camille A. Farrington, Stacy B. Ehrlich, and Ryan D. Heath; with David W. Johnson,
Sarah Dickson, Ashley Cureton Turner, Ashley Mayo, and Kathleen Hayes

Building off of the previously released literature review on noncognitive factors, this report pro-
vides a clear and detailed conceptual framework for supporting human development in schools and
society-at-large from preschool to college. The Framework provides a developmental lens on how
to best support students in the transition to high school. It also challenges high school educators
to think about the extent to which we are developing agency and integrated identity in develop-
mentally appropriate ways for adolescents, who have tremendously malleable mindsets and need
special attention in the transition to high school.

High School Graduation Rates through Two Decades of District Change:
The Influence of Policies, Data Records, and Demographic Shift

JUNE, 2016
Elaine M. Allensworth, Kaleen Healey, Julia A. Gwynne, and René Crespin

This report examines two decades of data on Chicago’s rising graduation rates and parses out dif-
ferent reasons for those improvements. While some increases in high school graduation rates could
be attributed to factors like increased student achievement in grades K-8 or changes in student de-
mographics, the authors find that the biggest contribution are increases in ninth grade factors, like
On-Track rates. The report also lays to rest concerns that Chicago’s graduation rate may be inflated
by artificial changes or factors outside the control of Chicago’s high schools. It makes clear that
authentic changes in course performance for Chicago’s freshmen has been the primary driver of the
20 percentage point increase in high school graduation rates over the last decade.

The Predictive Power of Ninth-Grade GPA

SEPTEMBER, 2017
John Q. Easton, Esperanza Johnson, and Lauren Sartain

This research report takes a deeper look at the importance of grades in ninth grade. The authors
find that while freshman GPA has risen steadily over the past decade, alarming differences in GPA
persist across race and gender as well as across high schools. The report further elaborates that a
student’s ninth grade GPA is a strong predictor of a wide range of later outcomes—including high
school graduation, college enrollment, and college persistence. Ninth grade GPA predicts these
outcomes better than standardized test scores, and the predictive power of GPA holds even when
controlling for variables such as student background, prior achievement, and high school choice.

This concept paper shares lessons learned about how, when, why, and under what conditions “the
use of data has supported real and sustainable improvement in Chicago’s public high schools. The
authors identify five lessons that apply to schools, districts, and researchers about how to use data
to change practice. Taken together, the lessons form an approach called “practice-driven data” and
can inform data work nation-wide.

Hidden Risk: Changes in GPA across the Transition to High School

OCTOBER, 2018
Alex Seeskin, Jenny Nagaoka, and Shelby Mahaffie

This report investigates the changes in GPA that students experience between 8th grade and 9th
grade. As researchers previously identified, the decline in GPA between 8th and 9th grade is about
a half a grade point for the average student, but these declines are different across schools and
across sub-groups of students. The largest GPA decline identified is for Chicago’s highest-achieving
Black students, who ended 8th grade with over a 3.5 GPA and declined .73 grade points on average.
Additionally, the researchers found that no single subject area was driving the declines in GPA, but
that low grades in non-core subject areas, like the arts and physical education, were a hidden risk to
students’ overall academic performance in 9th grade.

The Forgotten Year: Applying Lessons from Freshman Success to Sophomore Year

AUGUST, 2020
Alex Seeskin, Shelby Mahaffie, and Alexandra Usher

In light of over a decade of improvement in 9th grade course performance across Chicago’s high
schools, this report turns the focus to 10th grade. Researchers first validated that the 9th grade
on-track indicator is still just as predictive of high school graduation as it was when it was initially
calculated, reinforcing the importance of 9th grade as critical for improving high school graduation.
The report further finds that there is a group of students (about 8%) who fall off-track between 9th
and 10th grade, and that these students are very unlikely to graduate. Paying extra attention to
students who ended the 9th grade year on-track but also had a course failure or below 85% atten-
dance could help strengthen schools’ early warning indicator work as students progress into 10th
grade.

High School GPAs and ACT Scores as Predictors of College Completion: Examining
Assumptions about Consistency across High Schools

AUGUST, 2019
Elaine M. Allensworth and Kallie Clark

This analysis strengthens our ongoing understanding that high school GPA, rather than standard-
ized test scores, is the best available predictor of college-readiness. The authors find that the rela-
tionship between high school GPA and college graduation remains strong and reliable, even across
high schools. These findings are summarized in a working paper on the Consortium’s website, and
the final article is available in the academic journal Educational Researcher.

This slide deck breaks down the data system that Chicago schools
now use to monitor freshman success. As the On-Track work
evolved, UChicago Consortium researchers and the Network for
College Success collaborated to develop a broader data framework
to guide improvement efforts. Called the Risk and Opportunity
Framework, it now functions as a detailed early warning indicator
system for monitoring freshman success in schools throughout
Chicago. Adopting this new and more complex data system also
helped practitioners move from improving On-Track rates to
increasing freshman course performance to higher levels.

Prior to 2014, the UChicago Consortium
identified two crucial indicators for freshman
success: On-Track and Bs or Better. On-
Track is an early indicator of high school
graduation. UChicago Consortium research
shows that On-Track students are four times
more likely to graduate from high school than
their off track peers.

Bs or Better (meaning a student has a 3.0
GPA or better) is an important leading
indicator of college readiness. In addition,
students who earn above a 3.0 GPA in high
school are more than 50% likely to
graduate from college. Critically, high
school GPA, not test scores, is the best
predictor of college graduation.

Contents Purpose

Sample Job Descriptions Careful planning is vital for a strong Success Team. Administrators must

for Success Team Leads deliberately select team members that not only understand the importance

& Members of the transition to high school, but also genuinely care about the achievement
of their students. Strong Team Leads can build relationships with students

Freshman Academy and adults as well as facilitate data-driven conversations that lead to sound

Team Calendar Planning decision-making.

Considerations

How & When to Use

Administrators, along with the Team Lead, should refer to Tool Set A during
the initial phases of team planning and development. These tools provide ideas
and considerations as you develop the systems and structures for this work in
your school. Additionally, the job descriptions support your process for select-
ing team members. Some school communities have the resources to develop
an On-Track Coordinator role who manages the operations of Success Team
work.

Once formed, your Success Team can use these tools to support the clear
communication of meeting expectations and as a source for providing feed-
back to Team Leads.

Purpose

Team Leads and individuals responsible for supporting team leadership should
refer to this collection of tools. Regular, job-embedded support of the Success
Team Lead is a key component of the freshman success work. Team Leads are
often classroom teachers new to leadership and the responsibilities of leading
a team of adults. In the Network for College Success model, ongoing support is
provided by an external coach or facilitator. However, school-based support is
another option, such as from an administrator or veteran teacher-leader.

How & When to Use

Tool Set B provides practical activities to support new Team Leads to work
effectively with the administration as well as diverse team members. External
support organizations, similar to the Network for College Success, can also
refer to the to readings, activities, and presentations when planning.

ne major focus of the work of the Annen-

berg Institute for School Reform is devel-

oping and supporting educational leader-

ship with the vision and expertise needed
to transform schooling. The Institute’s Leadership
initiative seeks to influence, support, and sustain
models of shared leadership (teacher, principal,
superintendent, community) that help to improve
student achievement.

As part of its work in promoting effective
leadership practices, the Leadership initiative
staff convened a group of practitioners affiliated
with the Institute’s programs to reflect on and
write about innovative and effective leadership.
Ten of the resulting essays were published in a
two-part series on Leadership for Learning in the
September 2000 and June 2001 issues of Phi
Delta Kappan. A shorter version of “Stages of
Team Development” appeared in the June 2001
segment.

The Annenberg Institute for School Reform
was established at Brown University in 1993. Its
mission is to develop, share, and act on knowl-
edge that improves the conditions and outcome of
schooling in America, especially in urban com-
munities and in schools serving disadvantaged
children. The Institute pursues its mission in four
initiative areas: Leadership, Opportunity and
Accountability, District Redesign, and Commu-
nity-Centered Education Reform.

Nancy Mohr was the founding principal of University
Heights High School in the Bronx, where she served for ten
years. She currently works as an educational consultant
with reform projects and groups of educators throughout
the United States and in Australia. She also directs the New
York Regional Center of the National School Reform Faculty,
affiliated with the Horowitz Teacher Development Center at
New York University, and is a consultant to the National
School Reform Faculty at the Center for Reinventing Educa-
tion at the University of Washington. She is the author of
“Small Schools Are Not Miniature Large Schools,” in
William Ayers’s A Simple Justice: The Challenge of Small
Schools (Teachers College Press, 2000).

Alan Dichter was principal of Satellite Academy High
School, an alternative high school in New York City, for ten
years and also Director of the Lower Manhattan Outreach
Center, a program for overage students returning to school.
He served as Assistant Superintendent for Charter and New
School Development at the New York City Board of Educa-
tion before assuming his current position as Assistant
Superintendent for Executive Leadership Development, con-
ducting programs for aspiring principals and for future
superintendents and deputy superintendents. Also at the
Board of Education, he helped to create and oversees the
Executive Facilitators Academy, which helps leaders
develop and practice facilitation skills. He is the author of
several articles on leadership and professional develop-
ment and has consulted widely on issues related to urban

school reform.

Stages of Team Development

Lessons from the Struggles of Site-Based Management

Nancy Mohr and Alan Dichter

Organization wants to happen. Human
organizations emerge from processes that
can be comprehended but never con-
trolled.

— Margaret J. Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers
A Simpler Way

We had sensed for some time that something was
wrong — site-based management had not been
delivering the goods. We formed leadership teams;
they met; we shared decision making — but teaching
and learning didn’t change. “Perhaps too much had
been expected from simply the transfer of power,”
suggest Priscilla Wohlstetter and Susan Albers
Mohrman, who have written an extensive study
looking at the outcomes of sharing decision making
in schools. The idea always was to improve educa-
tion for kids; but instead what seemed to have hap-
pened in many places was that there was another
meeting to attend and nothing much else was new.
“Ts the theory flawed? Is the current wave of decen-
tralization just another swing of the pendulum?”
ask these authors, whose study of practice looked
at thirty schools in nine school districts, each of
which had at least four years’ experience with
school-based management.

We were asking ourselves the same questions.
As principals of alternative high schools in New

York City, we each had been deeply involved in

school reform for over fifteen years. Each of our
schools struggled incessantly with “group manage-
ment” at Satellite Academy High School and con-
sensus-based decision making at University Heights
High School. During this time, our own experiences
and observations, combined with those shared in
professional development opportunities with col-
leagues in other New York schools and around

the country, helped us learn a number of valuable
lessons.

We saw for ourselves the tremendous power
that can be generated within a school when the pro-
fessional staff genuinely experiences a sense of
ownership. But we learned that adult empowerment,
for its own sake, is too limited a goal. We found that
adult ownership, while necessary, does not in and
of itself make learning more powerful for students.
We learned how to get beyond ownership as a goal
and how to develop professional communities of
learners, focused on teaching and learning, that are
able to take advantage of the multiple perspectives
a community can offer.

Our conclusions, based on hands-on experi-
ence, are supported and illuminated by research
findings in recent literature. Michael Fullan (1993)
cites several studies of site-based-management proj-
ects, none of which found evidence of a strong con-
nection between shared decision making per se and
student learning. “The point is not that participation
in decision making is a bad thing,” Fullan cautions,
but “that it is not focusing on the right things —

the cultural core of curriculum and instruction.”


--- Page 139 ---
Participation may be necessary in order to build
the habits of collaboration, which are essential, but
it is not sufficient for improving student outcomes.

Robert Evans (1996) explores the kinds
of shared decision making that do create a link
between adult empowerment, student learning, and
leader behavior. “Teachers who are empowered to
make decisions about their school will structure
their classrooms to empower students in the learn-
ing process, encouraging students to take greater
responsibility for their own education,” he asserts.
“A key point ... is that empowerment’s true target
is not teachers or any other constituency, but the
school. ... To achieve it requires an authentic
leader to take the primary role in both shaping the
framework and nurturing the capacity of others to
help shape it.”

Fred Newmann and Gary Wehlage (1995)
show that higher student achievement has been
directly linked to the building of professional com-
munities — groups of educators who regularly meet
to discuss each other’s work and to learn from each
other about ways to improve teaching and learning.
Newmann’s work on authentic learning (1996)
points out why some schools in his study had higher
student achievement than others. In addition to
focusing on student learning, the achieving schools
nurtured professional community inside the school
and understood that “the promotion of intellectual
quality and professional community depended on
a complex interaction of cultural and structural
conditions.”

The most fundamental conclusion we have
drawn is that learning to share decision making in
a professional community that focuses on student
learning is a developmental process, and each stage
of that process offers discrete challenges and oppor-
tunities. When teachers form teams in their class-

rooms, the student groups will go through these

2 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

stages. When superintendents work with principals,
or their own staff, the same lessons apply. Just as
it is useful to remember that our children will and
must go through the terrible twos, it’s comforting to
remember that even our adult communities will and
must go through stages in their development and
will have to work through some fairly predictable
problems in order to emerge in a more mature state.

We now fully appreciate that the driving
question underlying this journey is not “When
does shared decision making work and when does
it not work?” but rather “What do you have to do
to develop a professional community to the point
where it is promoting rigor in teaching and learning
throughout a school?” We also know that leadership
is essential to the successful negotiating of this
journey. And we don’t mean only principal leader-
ship; teachers, parents, students, and district
administrators must all play essential leadership
roles.

The observations that follow illustrate the
developmental stages that faculties go through
en route to becoming learning organizations. Are
these stages as clear-cut and neat as we make them
sound? Of course not. We’ve lived through these
steps, and, like anyone who has worked with groups,
we know that little can be predicted and much can
go wrong. But these observations represent years of
reflection, and we strongly believe that a thorough
understanding of such a complex conceptual frame-
work — one which requires endless work and strug-
gle to implement truly and honestly, but which has
the potential to genuinely transform what happens
in classrooms for kids — is an indispensable tool
on this journey. In that spirit, we would like to
share our experiences — some joyous, some not —
about how that process plays out, what each stage
involves, and what is needed to work through each

stage and move on to the next.

The Honeymoon Stage

Emerging Community

This is terrific! Before, | was powerless; nobody
even asked my opinion. Finally, I’m part of a group
that meets with the leader. At last, | feel valued; | am

so happy that my voice is going to be heard.

I'm not always comfortable disagreeing with the
group, so far, especially when | have to do it publicly,
but it is exciting to feel that we will be able to make
real change; soon we'll be making a lot of important

decisions.

The eager group may begin by thinking that this

is going to be easy. It may forget to build, earlier
rather than later, some common goals. Is the intent
to give everyone a voice, or is it to improve the
intellectual quality of the school? Making decisions
without a clear sense of mission or shared vision
can create a battleground for personal interests.
Now is the time to clarify the method of making
decisions: why to make them, how to make them,
and which ones are appropriately made by the
group. The leader must unapologetically set limits
to the scope of the group’s initial work. These
limits can be open to discussion, but to pretend that
everything is up for grabs creates a lack of security
inappropriate for group health.

The leader must also be prepared to share and
move toward a vision of greater group involvement
based on capacity and on priorities. Problems can
be averted if consensus is introduced early as the
mode. Voting leads to factions, polarization, and a
history of resentment, since there are always losers
along with the winners. Consensus means having
to look for the win-win solution, which is not the
same as seeking a 100 percent vote and being held

hostage by the hold-outs.

The leader’s role in this stage is that of
designer. Groups are powerful, not in spite of, but
because of having multiple points of view. A variety
of viewpoints, however, does not necessarily pro-
duce the most creative outcomes. When a group is
in the early stages of working together, it does not
yet have a lot of collective knowledge. It is some-
times useful for the leader to solicit input, envision
a design, and then present a plan to the group. The
group can digest it, modify it, and then look for
agreement. Another strategy is for the group to
brainstorm possibilities, with a small group or a
leader putting it together into a design or plan.

What does not work is for a leader to come to
the group and say, “How do you want to schedule
classes? This is your school, so it’s up to you to tell
me what you want to do.” There is something a bit
hostile in this last approach. A leader had better be
self-reflective and should be clear if sharing leader-

ship is, in fact, what she/he wants.

Nancy bought bagels for her staff every Friday. It was to
thank them for their hard work, a personal way of appreciat-
ing them. When students came into her office early in the
morning and asked for bagels, she gave them to them as a
reward for being early to school. One Friday a teacher
expressed her sense that the bagels should be for the teach-
ers only and “proposed” to the staff, for agreement, that
there be no bagels for students. What Nancy had to point out
was that these were her bagels, purchased with her money,
and she was going to give them to whomever she wanted.
The teacher in the glow of the Honeymoon Stage thought
that teachers would now make decisions about everything
that happened in the school. It was disappointing to her to

find out that the Friday bagels were not in her purview.

The Conflict Stage

The Honeymoon Is Over

Who made that decision? | can’t buy in unless I’m

a part of what's going on.
| can’t work with that group.

We are supposed to be talking about instruction,
but we keep arguing about career day, the new
schedule, the budget for art supplies, and who's
going to teach that split program. When are we

going to work on something of substance?

Sometimes | feel like going back to my classroom
and closing the door; working with kids is easy

compared to this!

This is a natural (and valuable) stage for groups —
the stage of emerging controversy. And group
development theory tells us that not only is this
inevitable, but it is essential to developing a healthy
group. “In fact, a group without conflict may be in
serious difficulty; points of view are being masked
and inhibited, and good solutions cannot be worked
out” (Miles 1971). Whether it’s a group of two (a
marriage) or one hundred (the U.S. Senate), where
there are different people, there are different points
of view. What really matters is how you learn to deal
with those differences. So the very same conflict
resolution principles we use for students apply to
adults as well: an absolute insistence upon resolving
(not hiding) conflicts — combined with a few ground
rules for civil discourse — should do nicely for
starters.

It is helpful to warn the group that this stage
will come — before it happens. Knowing that conflict

is inevitable will lessen anxiety. The group would do

4 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

well to avoid being overly nice — trying to smooth
things over, ignoring problems. Dealing with petty
dilemmas skillfully will allow the group to venture
into the important (and difficult) issues — ones about
teaching and learning. Everyone has to learn how to
be a negotiator and/or mediator.

The leader’s role in this stage is to help the
group manage conflict. First, the leader must make
sure that all are committed to working on conflict
management. The temptation to avoid dealing with
conflict leads to resentment-collection and to the
mediocrity that comes of too much compromise.
There is also the temptation on the part of the group
to revert to being top-down because it’s “easier”
or “clearer,” and this must be acknowledged and
stopped. The leader should resist the urge to say,
with pride, “See, they want me to make all the
decisions.”

The leader in this stage is both a mediator
and a teacher of mediation and negotiation. “In the
schools in which faculty members were direct with
one another and had developed processes for airing
controversy, the faculty made changes that endured
and grew stronger over time. Where faculty mem-
bers had no capacity to deal with controversy they
were unable to move beyond existing practices”
(Wasley et al. 1997). Effective leaders have the
courage to confront difficult issues of race, gender,
class, etc. But they also “move from being the ones
who manage conflicts among group members to
being the ones who teach group members how to
manage their own conflicts” (Schwarz 1994).

However, effective leaders do not allow the
group to be used to settle issues that belong in face-

to-face, private conversations: “People around here


--- Page 142 ---
are late a lot; I think we should do something about
it” could be a legitimate topic for a group to take on
if it really is about a slippage in group norms. It
could also be a cover-up for the speaker’s unwilling-
ness or inability to assertively confront one person
who is chronically late.

Leaders must also help groups set norms.
Good leaders do this publicly, taking every opportu-
nity to reinforce them with the group. This might
take the form of reviewing a written document or of
routinely reminding people how certain events were
consistent with shared agreements. This reinforce-
ment comes from regularly reflecting on how the
group is doing and on whether or not the norms are
still the ones we believe are important. Leaders con-
tinually remind the group about “how we do things
around here,” especially when it has been tough to
do the right thing. Norms are different from rules —
we know we will sometimes fall back, but there are

no recriminations when this happens.

Cecccccccccccccccccccccccccecceccccccs
In the early days of building a new school, Nancy found that
each semester teachers were changing their teaching
teams. At first she felt it was good to let people choose the
teachers they wanted to work with and encouraged the staff
to make adjustments in order to come up with the best
configurations. The problem was that eventually there were
some people who couldn't or wouldn’t work with anyone
else. Once she realized what was happening, she knew that
it had to stop. The building of community in a school has to
be more like marriage than dating. Problems have to be
worked out. Issues have to be addressed. And you can't
continually change partners rather than work things
through. It became clear that the same thing had been hap-
pening in classrooms. Students (and teachers) looked for-
ward to the next semester when they could change group-
ings, hoping that things would be better next time. The
school realized that students and teachers became much
stronger and wiser when they learned how to work out their

differences and learned to stay together over time — leading

to relationships where members had deeper knowledge of
one another. When this happened, the teaching and learning
could take place on a new level because teachers knew
how individual students learned best and students knew that
they could work out problems with adults. Adults and stu-
dents could appreciate each other because of, not in spite
of, all their complexity.

Alan’s school, which had four sites, each with its own
teacher-director, had had a history of competition among the
sites. Resources were either strictly divided or they were
allocated through a convoluted reliving of the history: “You
got extra funding two years ago.” “Remember that time we
let you buy books? Now it’s our turn.” It took an enormous
amount of work to redesign the culture of the school to
become one in which the greater good could be the decid-
ing factor in how allocations were made. Sites began to see
themselves as part of a whole instead of as rival factions.
How was this done? The only way changes to a culture take
place: over time and through constant reinforcement. Alan
had to not only voice the new set of norms and beliefs, but
also ensure that they were always being practiced. And he
had to do this not as an authoritarian, but as someone whose
responsibility it was to regularly remind the group of what it
stood for and why it was there. And he had to do it over and
over. It took several years; there just was no fast way. They
all knew they had “arrived” when the management teams
from all four sites readily agreed to a proposal from Alan that
one site which was going through a particularly difficult
transition be funded for an extra teacher for the entire year
simply because they needed it. And rather than resent it, the
members of the group spoke about feeling good about their

collective ability to get beyond their individual interests.

The Confusion-about-Democracy Stage
What’s the Leader Supposed to Do?

Sure, you say I’m empowered, but as long as we

have a leader, he/she still holds all of the chips.

Sometimes decisions are made without me — why
should | feel buy-in? Furthermore, who decides
who gets to make which decisions? We need

specific processes and procedures.

If we're a democratic group, why does the leader
have more influence than | have? If we're all lead-
ers, why do we need someone in charge? There’s

always a hidden agenda.

| may be ready for empowerment, but I’m not so
sure about the others. | don’t know if they're as
committed/talented/trustworthy as | am. Maybe it’s
better to just forget about it and let the leader do it

all — then at least we know who to blame.

“The role of school management — principals and
superintendents — has not received much attention
in SBM [school-based management] plans,” Wohl-
stetter and Mohrman (1996) note. “Private sector
experience has found that such roles are pivotal

in successful decentralization.” Groups come to
learn that the roles that leaders play are essential —
after all, who is going to push us when we get stuck,
do that work we’d rather not do, and remind us of
our agreements? In fact, without a strong leader
making sure these things happen, our “democratic”
process sometimes stalls because one or two people
dominate the conversation and we all get disgusted.
Evans (1996) calls this kind of leadership

“authentic”:

Authentic leaders ... want to optimize col-

lective involvement and professional com-

6 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

munity, but ... they will not sacrifice sub-
stance for process, clarity and focus for a
management modality. They do not aban-
don traditional authority; they use it judi-
ciously, building involvement as they can
in a variety of informal as well as formal
ways, but asserting themselves as they
must. They provide a binary leadership
that is both top-down and bottom-up. In
this way they avoid the pitfalls that can
turn empowerment and collaboration into
quagmires and they help school communi-
ties deepen the commitment on which

improvement depends.

Leadership can vary and move around, but
when it comes down to it, no matter how much
decision making is shared, there does have to be
someone who is in charge — and we have to know
who that is. Otherwise, we all can spend an inordi-
nate amount of time either duplicating each other’s
efforts or waiting for someone to be decisive.

This stage can be confusing to everyone.
Wohlstetter and Mohrman (1996) state that “studies
of effective public schools agree that a strong cen-
tral leader, like the principal, is key to successful
management. An effective leader can set the
school’s vision, serve as an instructional leader,
coordinate reform efforts and rally support for the
school.” Yet, in the same document, under “Why
School-Based Management Fails,” the authors cau-

tion that

principals who work from their own
agenda, not helping to develop a common
one ... are perceived as too autocratic by
their staffs. ... [T]his often led to a power

struggle between teachers and the princi-


--- Page 144 ---
pal over who controlled the school.
Teachers frequently referred to “the prin-
cipal’s vision” in schools where the lead-

ership was autocratic.

Making sense of all of this is not impossible,
but reconciling concepts which seem to be in oppo-
sition to each other is what makes the job of the
leader so complex and so far above the more clear-
cut management hierarchies of the past.

Leaders at this stage must strive to prevent
the group from falling into “process worship,” where
following the procedures and processes, designed to
make sure that voices are heard, becomes the goal
rather than the means to an end. Allowing processes
to become a substitute for using judgment can lead
to well-executed but terrible decisions. Or even
worse, it can lead to stagnation and frustration. It’s
the leader’s job to regularly prioritize and repriori-
tize and help the group to keep straight what’s
important.

The leader needs to make sure that the
changes that are taking place are systemic, not
cosmetic. “Schools struggled with SBM when they
simply layered SBM on top of what they were already
doing” (Wohlstetter and Mohrman, 1996). The
leader must not be seen as playing favorites and
must keep the process honest. The leader must
teach all of the players to develop the habit of con-
sulting one another regularly and must facilitate
that consultation, making sure that it happens.

And then the leader has to help the group see that
it has a responsibility to not only trust each other
but to trust the leader as well, just as the leader has
trusted them. The leader both models and teaches
inclusion. It is not good enough to say, “You had

the opportunity to object, participate, etc.”” Opportu-
nities not only have to be presented, but promoted.
Involvement and involving others are not options.

And the leader has to be comfortable being a leader.

One responsibility that must be assumed by
everyone involved in an organization where shared
decision making is taking place is to avoid the
“in-crowd/out-crowd syndrome.” Groups that work
effectively within larger organizations understand
that they must spend a lot of time communicating
with those outside the group — and those outside the
group have an equal responsibility for being willing
to believe that the group’s purpose is to help the
whole and that being a good group member means
not wasting one another’s time. This means not
whining, not forgetting the real reason you are all

there.

Alan's school was confronted with a problem at one of the
sites. There was a staff member who was not an effective
teacher, and the staff wanted the teacher-director to deal
with the problem. So he did ... and asked the teacher to
leave the school. Then the staff was upset, saying it was
their right to make decisions and that they had wanted the
director to deal with the problem, but not make a decision on
his own. They were told that the decision would stand, but
that there would have to be an immediate plan for an inter-
vention process so that in the future whenever there was a
personnel issue, it would be clear how it would be handled
and the process would be known to everyone. There was
resistance to making this plan. The crisis was over and they
wanted to “move on.” The leader had to insist. This is one
example of a changing leadership role. While it was no
longer appropriate for the leader to make unilateral deci-
sions, it was essential to take the lead in making sure that
there were procedures in place, ones which ensured demo-
cratic outcomes and which did not rely on peer pressure

alone for accountability.

The Messy Stage

Now Things Are Even Less Clear

This team’s work is sloppy; | need more clarity and

control.

If this is supposed to make me feel “bought-in,” it’s
not working. I'm working harder now and getting

less done.
It's fun to be collegial, but where is it getting us?

I'm still not always comfortable with all of our deci-
sions. Sometimes | don’t even remember why |
agreed to something. And when we have to include
different perspectives — kids, parents, etc. — that

really slows us down.

There’s no time to do anything right, let alone get to

the important issues.

Learning to love risk-taking and ambiguity is a tall
order, but it has to happen. It’s hard to celebrate
mistakes and avoid the safe route. To help it hap-
pen, there must be systems in place to maximize
communications among all of the members of the
group. Instead of a clear line of authority that is
very neat but not very effective, there can and
should be multiple forms of communicating — a sort
of circulatory system for the organism, one which
keeps the blood moving.

The organization needs multiple groups with
varied tasks and foci. This way the power is truly
dispersed throughout the school and is not simply
vested in one group instead of the principal. So the
next time someone says, “What, another meeting?”
there has to be a reminder that meetings, when well

run, are truly valuable. The alternative would be to

8 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

go back to a clear line of authority with meetings
that are used only to transmit information, top-
down. Meetings can themselves be learning experi-
ences if run effectively, but that means planning
and organization. Wohlstetter and Mohrman (1996)
“found that school-based management required a
redesign of the whole school organization that goes
far beyond a change in school governance.”

Another source of messiness is the need to
include all stakeholders.

Involving stakeholders ... isn’t enough to
ensure all voices are heard. ... Decisions
that emerge from integrating multiple per-
spectives are bound to be better than
decisions made by a single person or from
a single perspective. Yet it takes time and
skill to integrate multiple perspectives,
especially when there are power differ-
ences among the diverse groups. This is a
challenge worth meeting if school teams
are to think creatively and in new ways to
better serve all their students. (Hergert

1997)

The leader’s role in this stage is to help the
group be comfortable with messiness, pointing out
that it’s OK and is part of real life. “Comfortable”
doesn’t always mean relaxed and happy. When
members of the group say, “I’m not comfortable with
that,” they can be gently encouraged to understand
that their comfort is not the major goal of the school
and that maybe their discomfort is a sign that there
is learning taking place. The goal is to feel safe
enough to indulge in risk-taking. The leader resists
being “Father/Mother Knows Best” and continues

to help the group appreciate that it can find a good


--- Page 146 ---
route, and that there is no one right answer. The
leader cannot and should not try to prevent mis-
takes from happening. Mistakes should be wel-
comed, examined, and understood as natural phe-
nomena — a necessary part of learning.

On the other hand, leaders must strive to
develop those systems and communications that will
eventually bring order out of chaos and follow up,
follow up, follow up. Solutions have to be real. Miles
(1990) distinguishes between traditional coping
(e.g., using normal routines or working harder as the
way to solve the problem) and “deep coping,” which
is doing whatever has to be done to solve the prob-
lem (e.g., change the schedule, provide time, make
sure it happens). “Serious reform ... is changing the
culture and structure of the school,” says Michael
Fullan (1991). “As long as we have schools and
principals, if the principal does not lead changes
in the culture of the school, or if he or she leaves
it to others, it normally will not get done.”

The leader must also lead professional devel-
opment. Leaders foster professional practice by put-
ting in place processes and structures that promote
teacher collaboration and collective responsibility
(Lieberman et al. 1988, McLaughlin and Yee 1988).
The leader plays a key role in fostering a sense of
collective responsibility among the faculty such that
problems of teachers’ performance are viewed not
as individual failure but as the concern of the whole
faculty (McLaughlin and Yee 1988).

It is important for both the leader and the
group to begin to see their work as engaging in
problem solving and learning, rather than “problem
hiding” (McLaughlin and Yee 1988). When the
group focuses on learning, it finds that it is making
better decisions and that its process becomes more
and more seamless (and more efficient). As the
group sees itself learning together through profes-

sional dialogue, through seeking out information

and evidence, through self-reflection and a feedback
process, then they are moving to becoming a profes-
sional community. The group and the leader are
able to now use the skills they were developing in
earlier stages. “Learning and improvement of per-
formance will occur only from serious peer and
group assessments of how well their own judgments
are working” (Louis and Miles 1990).

There is a particular problem of messiness
for the leader, who is expected to simultaneously
strengthen cross-fertilization and collaboration;
maintain calm, order, and the sense that someone
is in control; promote strong cultural norms, values,
and beliefs; and include everyone’s voice in setting
the agenda. Making sense of these seemingly dis-
parate goals is the hard but critical work of the

leader in this stage.

Nancy came to understand that her role as the professional
development leader of the school meant that she not only
had the responsibility to design and run professional devel-
opment activities at staff meetings (where announcements
were banned), but she also spent her entire day in a variety
of meetings — leadership team, curriculum planners, office
staff, long-term planners, etc. Each of these meetings was a
part of the professional development web in the school. But
the realization grew that it was simple enough to spend
meeting time perseverating about details. So, the rule
became that every meeting would have as half of its agenda
a professional topic, and that the topic would come first, not
after the business (when it frequently didn’t happen at all).
This became a school community habit and each team that
met understood that its purpose, first and foremost, was to
learn together, and this included reading articles and build-
ing on prior knowledge. For Nancy, as the principal, it meant
doing all of those other principal's chores early in the morn-
ing and late in the day. She felt it was worth it to keep these
multiple conversations going.

The Scary Stage

Where's the Authority and Accountability ?

| know | said | wanted to be a part of a professional
community, but maybe “they” do know better than
we. Actually, | sometimes hope so, because | feel

less and less sure about what should happen.

Whose fault is it if something goes wrong? Sud-
denly | don’t feel so powerful, | just feel more of a

heavy responsibility.
Where’s the validation; what are the rules?

I'm just not sure | want to be responsible for talking
about what's going on in other people's classrooms,
about what standards should be, about what we
should teach. After all, if we open that up, then |
have to be willing to hear stuff about my own work,

and that is truly scary.

Participation in making decisions does not in any
way ensure that the group automatically takes on
real responsibility for what happens; in fact, it can
sometimes get the urge to back off and look around
for someone or something to blame. Evans (1996)
remarks that “few teachers, it seems, want to be
fully empowered and collegial.”

It is important that the group build an
accountability system that ensures its work is based
on substantive information and data and not solely
on the opinions and preferences of its members.
Accountability is built on the lateral flow of infor-
mation sharing and on the group’s ability to critique
itself. It is in this stage that the group begins to see
itself as a professional learning community rather

than merely a decision-making group. It really is

10 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

moving into genuinely shared leadership. Once this
happens, the group sees that what makes a true pro-
fessional community is a systemic approach to a
“collective rather than individual accounting for
school outcomes” (McLaughlin and Yee 1988). Now
the group is shifting to an instructional focus and
aligning its teaching practice with those values and
beliefs by using reflective practice and dialogue.

What can be really scary is when there is
no improvement in student performance after the
group has been working so hard. Remember the
findings: higher student achievement has been
directly linked to the building of professional
community (Newmann and Wehlage 1995). So the
group has to make sure it is not only working hard,
but working together in productive ways. Wasley,
Hampel, and Clark (1997) describe some of the
key conditions that foster teacher learning (see
sidebar).

By now, the group will have a history of suc-
cessfully dealing with challenges. The leader's role
at this stage is to move the group from its initial
successes toward the next stage: public accountabil-
ity. The leader reminds the group of what has been
learned and cites specific examples of the group
exceeding its own expectations. The leader reminds
the group that it has already been accountable in
many ways and that institutionalizing a collective
accountability is the last challenge. Having built in
the habit of reflection, the leader will now find the
group ready to be more publicly accountable. This
will not, however, be an instinctive next step. The
courageous leader starts by being self-reflective and

then helps the group to hold a mirror up to itself.

KEYS TO FOSTERING TEACHER LEARNING

¢ Time: “Few faculty or central office staff or state departments have yet created adequate conditions for

adult learning in their schools.”

Collegiality: “Despite the fact that we have understood the importance of collegiality for a number of

years, most schools maintain a strong culture of individuality and isolation.”

Analytical capacity: “Reflective activity needs to be more critically analytical. ... [Teachers] need to ask
themselves why they are attempting new techniques; ... then they need to examine whether the changes

they are attempting are getting what they hoped for. ... To be more critically analytical, teachers need to

develop the skills of giving and receiving regular feedback on their work in classrooms.”

Expertise: “Teachers need a readily available support system of experts who are knowledgeable. ... A

common practice is to suggest that a teacher who has been out to a workshop function as the resident

expert for the school. Unfortunately, sophisticated understanding takes a great deal more time and effort.”

(from Wasley et al. 1997)

Peer assessment and accountability in Alan’s school had,
over the years, come to exist more in theory than in practice.
People met in “peer groups,” having found many reasons
not to visit one another's classes; or, if they did visit, by all
accounts they gave each other very superficial and very
positive feedback. There was a growing concern that a num-
ber of teachers who were in need of substantial support and
help were, in fact, not getting the kind of “critical friendship”
they needed. In order to revitalize this theoretically existing
procedure, Alan kept bringing the question to the table:
What are we doing about this? Let’s share examples. Let’s be
a problem-solving group. Why are we resisting? What is so
difficult about giving and getting critical feedback? How can
we stop letting ourselves off the hook? He would hear from
staff members privately that they were concerned, but they
were reluctant to say it out loud. His goal was to make that
voice public. His job was not “enforcer” but “relentless
advocate” for the group to grow and collectively look at the
problem, to make sure that the environment was safe, that
there was respect, and that there was a reduced tolerance

for collective denial.

The Mature-Group Stage

A Professional Learning Community

Finally, we're proactive and make our own agendas
rather than reacting to those of others. We also
have learned to be inclusive and are avoiding “us”

and “them” scenarios.

We have learned to focus on learning as a group
rather than making decisions before we have
enough knowledge. In fact, we have realized that
the point is to make high-quality decisions — ones
that are better because they include more points of

view.

We realize that we have to give up some of our own
preferences in order to see the bigger picture and
to work on the common good. We can agree to del-
egate more often, and while we seek critical feed-
back, we don’t waste each other's time in micro-

management.

Our meetings are themselves now professional
development opportunities instead of battle-

grounds for issues.

Now, finally, we're talking about teaching and
learning and about raising standards, not merely
“setting” them. And we're all taking responsibility
for making sure that happens; we've stopped point-

ing the mental finger at one another.

The leader’s role in this stage is to keep the group
from becoming complacent, making it clear that
“we'll probably never be ‘there,’” and that there is
always a next step in the cycle of assessment and
reforming. But, at the same time, the leader helps

the group appreciate the habits they have institu-

12 STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT

tionalized and the cultural norms that support the

progress that has been made.

Coccccccccccccccccccecccccceccecccccce
In Alan’s school, annual reports, a synthesis of teacher
reflections, were written by each of the four sites. In order
to maintain this valued but burdensome expectation, he
instituted a process that improved its chances of being val-
ued by the school community. Not only were copies shared
with everyone (an accountability strategy) but the leaders of
the sites spent two hours critiquing the overall report. Rou-
tinely, these reports were introduced by a reminder of the
number of years the school had done this, and a ten-year
timeline was developed tracing the critical growth of the
school directly through these documents. And while every-
one still found the process burdensome, no one would con-
sider finishing out the year without an annual report. And

everyone made sure their reflections were included.

The concept of the “church year” helped Nancy understand
what she had to do in her school. Having grown up a minis-
ter’s daughter, she was very familiar with the cycle but never
quite understood its value. Every October there was an
appreciation of the harvest. There were the same lessons,
the same hymns, even the same colors used. In her school,
it became clear that October had a different meaning — it
was the “conflict month.” After the “honeymoon” of Sep-
tember, there were inevitably squabbles among students
and even among staff. It helped enormously to anticipate
this and say, “October is coming.” This reminded the school
community to have conversations in family groups about
handling conflict and to have staff meetings where there
were reviews of the procedures needed and the ways to
prevent conflict from becoming combat. Not only were new
members of the community introduced to the habits and the
culture of the school, but older members were honored for
their roles in the school’s history and at the same time had

their memories jogged.

A Transforming
Experience

In our years of evolving understanding about leader-
ship, empowerment, and professional community,
we learned, as principals, to be better learners and
teachers ourselves. It was simply not good enough
to hope learning would happen because we set up
structures, brought in outside experts, and/or sent
teachers to workshops. Authentic learning required
an authentic learning community, one that learned
from research, from its own experience, and from
its own analysis of that experience. And all of that
required that we do the same thing.

Forming a learning community was like plan-
ning for a class — and we learned that just as a good
teacher would not dream of teaching in a rigid, arbi-
trary manner, neither would she/he initially turn it
over to the students. Good teachers know it is their
job to teach the students how to be good learners,
how to take on responsibility, and how to value one
another’s voices. And good teachers do not leave it
to chance. It’s no different for good leaders.

We found that developing and participating
in a genuine learning community, with shared deci-
sion making focused on student learning, is more
than a task; it is a changed way of being. For a
group to learn to see professional development as a
collective rather than as an individual responsibil-
ity, it must challenge deeply ingrained ways of
doing things. John Goodlad (1994) comments

on this same realization in a broader forum:

It is difficult for many and impossible for
some groups and enterprises to align their
self-interests with the public good, and
that is what an educative role in the posi-
tive sense invariably requires. It is
equally difficult for a public which was
educated much more for individual devel-

opment and competition than for personal
responsibility and community welfare to
sort out the degree to which adversaries
are indeed locked in struggles that affect
us all when one side claims to be for the
common good. ... Such matters are not
part of the human conversation for most of

us.

We also learned that a genuine learning com-
munity must never forget that building consensus
and focusing on adult learning are not ends in
themselves but only a starting place, a structure
that works no miracles unless it is used wisely and
well. These efforts are only really useful if student
achievement is the overarching goal. Focusing on
adult learning requires, paradoxically, that we not
focus on ourselves, our needs, and our comfort
level. Rather, our learning has to be about what
works for kids, whatever it takes. Whenever we lose
sight of that, we squander precious time and energy.

None of this happens overnight. By being
prepared for the problems that adult groups will
encounter as they struggle with how to work
together effectively to increase student learning,
educators can mindfully evolve, stage by stage, into
true learning communities. They will learn to view
power differently, to make learning more meaningful
for kids, and maybe even to model a just and demo-

cratic mini-society.

Thirteen Tips to Effective Upward Management

By Lonnie Pacelli
So let's get right into this....

Have you ever known a manager who held great respect of his or her team but was
not respected by his or her management? Or maybe you've had a manager that just
couldn't get things done effectively because he or she just didn't know how to "work
the system"? Or even still, are you are a manager who is continually frustrated
because you can't get your manager to do what you need him or her to do? If any of
these sound familiar to you, welcome to the world of ineffective upward
management.

Upward management is one of those skills that some do very well, many never seem
to master, and virtually all learn only through on-the-job lessons-learned. When done
well, both the manager and employee work as a team to ensure each other is
informed, address problems before they spin out of control, and be more effective at
managing. When done poorly, both manager and employee are not only ineffective
at getting the job done but are chronically frustrated due to mis-steps and surprises.

Through the years I've come to categorize most poor upward managers into four
personality types:

co The Brown-Noser - This is the employee who treats his boss as some kind of
rock star and constantly searches for what his boss wants to hear. Rather
than upwardly managing, the brown-noser upwardly affirms whatever it is the
boss is thinking.

co The Rebellious Teenager - This is the employee who consciously conceals
information from her boss because she wants to demonstrate that she can get
things done without help from her boss. Rather than upwardly managing, the
rebellious teenager keeps her manager in the dark by withholding information.

coo The Cowardly Lion - This is the employee who simply is afraid to share
information with his boss because he fears his boss' reactions. Rather than
upwardly managing, the cowardly lion avoids sharing information unless
completely painted into a corner.

co The Erupting Volcano - This is the employee who subscribes to the "more is
better" school of information management and will tell her manager every gory
detail of every single event every single day. Rather than upwardly managing,
the erupting volcano spews data like hot lava and forces her manager to pick
out the important facts.

So how do you avoid miss-steps in managing upward? Give this baker's dozen a
look and see if one or two of these nuggets can help you be a better upward
manager:

coo #1 - Understand your boss - Think about how your boss likes to
communicate; does she prefer written emails or verbal discussion? Does she
like structured one-on-one meetings or informal chats? Get a clear
understanding of how your boss likes to engage and adapt your style to her
style.

o #2 - Stick to objective facts - When presenting information avoid
emotionally-biased assessments. Sure, you may have put your heart and soul
into a project but if the project no longer makes business sense to do then it's
your responsibility to put personal feelings aside and do the right business
thing.

coo #3 - Don't dump problems on his or her doorstep that you should be
solving yourself - Yes, your manager has greater responsibility than you,
probably gets paid more than you, and most likely has more organizational
influence than you. That doesn't mean you get to delegate things you should
be solving yourself. Handle the problems that you're paid to handle and enlist
your boss for the stuff that requires his influence in the organization.

coo #4 - Be specific about what you need - Whether it be money, resources, or
some other form of assistance, be very specific about what you need, why you
need it, and what will happen if you don't get what you need. Credible
objectivity is crucial here: if it looks as if you are "stacking the deck" by
exaggerating consequences or embellishing benefits you're likely to not get
what you need. Also, subsequent asks are going to be viewed with greater
skepticism.

coo #5 - Don't ever give reason for your boss to question your credibility -
Simply put, if you get caught stretching the truth on even the smallest of facts,
you've now given your boss reason to question not only the little things but

--- Page 161 ---
Published in PM World Today - Spetember 2008 (Vol. X, Issue IX)

also the big things. You've got to stay pure with your boss and protect your
integrity by never allowing your credibility to be put to question.

coo #6 - Don't manage upward at the expense of managing downward - I've
known one too many managers who did a great job of keeping his boss happy
but had a team that wanted to string him up by his thumbs. Look, at some
point in time those that manage up at the expense of managing down will get
found out and will have to pay the piper. Don't play Russian roulette with your
career by keeping your boss comfy while ticking off your team.

coo #7 - Respect your boss’ time - Got a meeting with your boss? Show up on
time, come prepared to discuss whatever topics need discussing, and end the
meeting on time. Your boss is busy and her time should be utilized as
effectively as possible. Don't let your boss see your meetings with her as a
waste of time.

coo © #8 - Diligently follow through on commitments - So your boss asks you to
complete an assignment by tomorrow. You agree to meet the commitment.
The deadline passes and you haven't met the commitment and all you can
offer up is some lame excuse. Sheesh. Even if you think an assignment
given to you is the dumbest assignment on earth, if you've made a
commitment to do it then meet the commitment. Not following through shows
a lack of respect for your boss and breeds distrust.

coo #9 - Present options - In decision making managers like to see alternatives
and the consequences associated with each alternative. Some of the best
decision making meetings I've been in with my bosses have been where we
had meaningful dialogue around two or three viable options to resolving a
tough problem. My job in the process was to frame up the options, provide
facts to support each option, and provide a recommendation. Sometimes the
recommendation was taken, sometimes not; the most important thing was that
a good decision was made because there was good informed discussion.

coo #10 - Make your boss look good - Let's say that your boss is due to make a
presentation to his boss and is relying upon you to provide some critical
information. You give your boss the information he needs and he presents it
to his boss. He then gets fricasseed because the information is wrong. Guess
whose office he stops at first on his way back from getting barbecued? Simply
put, don't put your boss in a situation where he looks bad in front of his
management; you've not only hurt your credibility, you've hurt his credibility.

coo #11 - Don't suck up - Telling your boss what she wants to hear can label you
as a spineless know-nothing who doesn't have the intestinal fortitude to
manage effectively on your own. You'll not only quickly lose the respect of
your team, your boss will ultimately see through you and not respect your
leadership abilities. Sure, you may get the occasional self-absorbed manager
that craves shameless idolatry; but by and large bosses view sucking up as
incompetence.

coo #12 - No surprises - Ever tell your boss that your project is on schedule and
on budget then at the last minute spring a huge schedule or budget slip on
her? Particularly early in my career I've had this happen more than once. For
it to happen more than once is shameful to say the least. Bosses don't like
surprises where they are forced to accept a problem without having the option
to try to fix it before it got out of control. When you see problems make sure
you inform your boss; just make sure you're working diligently to resolve the
problem and not just to cover your @$$.

co #13 - Admit mistakes...quickly - Look, screw-ups happen. Heaven knows
that I've got more screw-ups to my name than many managers will ever see.
The important thing is to own up to your mistakes quickly and outline what you
are going to do to rectify the mistake. Being the last one to recognize you've
made a mistake just diminishes your credibility, so own up to those gaffes and
get to work fixing them.

Upward management: sometimes a real pain, many times a diversion, but always a

necessity. Take stock of your upward management skills and see where you might
need to tie up some loose ends using some of these nuggets.

Artistry, Choice, and Leadership

BOOK REVIEW

Christian T. K.-H. Stadtlander

Reframing Organizations: Artistry,
Choice, and Leadership

Lee G. Bolman and Terrence E. Deal

(Jossey-Bass, San Francisco,
California, U.S.A.; 2003;ISBN 0-
7879-6427-1) U.S. $38.00

Organizations are complex entities, of-
ten difficult to understand. Many factors
make organizational life complicated,
ambiguous, and unpredictable. The big-
gest challenge for managers and leaders is
to find the right way to frame our organi-
zations in a world that has become more
global, competitive, and turbulent. The
book by Bolman and Deal is a marvelous
work on understanding how organiza-
tions function. It also provides practical
suggestions for reframing organizations
in order to adapt them better to current
business realities.

Bolman and Deal focus on both man-
agement and leadership. ‘The authors be-
lieve that organizations face several dan-
gers. If, for example, an organization is
overmanaged but underled, it will even-
tually lose any kind of sense of purpose
and spirit. On the other hand, a poorly
managed organization with a strong and
charismatic leader may soar briefly only to
experience a significant downfall shortly
thereafter. Bolman and Deal suggest that
we need today more people in managerial
roles who can deal with organizational
confusion and chaos by establishing or-
der and finding simplicity; we need man-
agers who love their work and organiza-
tions, and respect the people whose lives
they affect. Leaders should be both art-
ists and analysts, who are flexible and ver-
satile enough to reframe their experience,
as well as constantly seek new issues and
discover possibilities. The authors also
suggest that leaders and managers should
view management more as a moral and
ethical undertaking and should attempt
to combine business realism with a pas-
sionate commitment to larger values and
purposes.

In Reframing Organizations, Bolman
and Deal concentrate mainly on organi-
zation theory's implications for practice.
This makes their book not only extreme-
ly valuable for managers and future lead-
ers of organizations but also for manage-
ment consultants who advice managers
and leaders on a variety of organizational
issues, The authors use a four-frame
model (structural, human resource, po-
litical, and symbolic), indicating that the
same situation can be viewed in at least
four different ways. Each of these frames
is distinctive, coherent, and powerful, yet

Vol. 12, No. 1 (2007)

when taken together, they help capture
a comprehensive picture of an organiza-
tion's situation. These frames can be used
to identify what is wrong in organizations
and what can be done to correct it.

The four frames have their own im-
age of reality. Each frame can be char-
acterized as follows: (1) The Structural
Frame (metaphors: Factory or machine)
emphasizes goals, specialized roles, and
formal relationships; this frame can be
used to organize and structure groups
and teams to get results and fit an or-
ganizations environment and _ technol-
ogy. (2) The Human Resource Frame
(metaphor: Family) sees the organization
through the lens of human needs, emo-
tions, skills, and relationships; the goal
is to align organizational and human
needs to build positive interpersonal and
group dynamics. (3) The Political Frame
(metaphor: Jungle) has to do with power,
conflict, competition, and organizational
politics; this frame can be used to cope
with power and conflict, build suitable
coalitions and hone political connections,
and deal with both internal and external
politics. (4) The Symbolic Frame (meta-
phors: Carnival, temple, or theater) sees
organizations as cultures, propelled more
by rituals, ceremonies, stories, heroes, and
myths than by rules, policies, and mana-
gerial authorities; the goal of this frame
is to shape a culture that gives a purpose
and meaning to workers, provides organ-
izational drama for internal and external
audiences, and build team spirit through
ceremony and story.

The theories presented in this book
were derived from research conducted
with a variety of organizations from dif-
ferent sectors around the globe. Bolman
and Deal analyzed organizations such as
McDonald’s in India, Citibank, Enron,
Kodak, Harley-Davidson, Volvo France,
NASA, the U.S. Air Force, Nordstrom,
Harvard University, and the U.S. Con-
gress in regard to individual aspects of
the organizational frames. This approach
makes the four-frame model relevant and
applicable to any type of domestic and in-
ternational organization.

Bolman and Deal believe that multi-
frame thinking requires elastic move-
ment that lies beyond narrow and me-
chanical approaches for understanding

organizations. When managers and leaders apply the holistic
model, they view organizations through all four frames (peo-
ple, power, structure, and symbols); this gives them an array of
options and development opportunities. For example, people in
organizations will improve on bargaining, become more open
to training, learn how to celebrate success, and lose fear of reor-
ganizing and reframing; they suddenly see the need to develop
creativity, risk-taking, and playfulness; they will find the right
questions and answers, and search for a deeper meaning and
faith despite chaos and confusion; this eventually leads to the
development of passionate, committed, flexible, and ethical, as
well as understanding and responding managers and leaders
who move the organization forward in a constantly changing
business environment.

The book also provides the reader with information about
important articles and books published in this field. A series
called “Greatest Hits from Organization Studies’ is displayed as
sidebars throughout the book and represent valuable summa-
ries of key ideas from the most influential works in the scholarly
literature as well as summaries of management best-sellers. For
this, the authors developed two lists: (1) The “greatest hits” as
rated by scholars and (2) Best-sellers as represented in the list
of Business Week. A summary of these lists is provided in the
Appendix.

The book concludes with a section on improving leadership

practice by applying the four-frame model. More specifically, var-
ious issues related to the challenges of leadership are discussed,
including integration issues, opportunities and perils, the dis-
tinct image of leaders and leadership, creating change, as well as
ethics and spirit. Bolman and Deal then illustrate the process,
art, and choice of reframing an organization by following a new
principal through his first week in an urban high school. This
high school is used as an example for an organization in trouble,
similar to a corporation in crisis, a struggling hospital, or an em-
battled public agency. This case study essentially demonstrates
how Bolman and Deal's theories would play out in practice by
applying the four-frame model to a real world problem.

All in all, I found this book to be superbly written and well
illustrated. It provides the reader with a 19-page list of cited ref-
erences useful for further in-depth study of management topics
related to organizational issues. This book is a useful text for
managers and leaders who want to learn more about the func-
tioning of organizations. It is also a superb guide for consult-
ants who advice in organizations junior and senior managers,
section leaders, and executives. Finally, this book is an excellent
text for graduate students and scholars in business and educa-
tion schools who are interested in learning how organizations
function by studying the basics, cases, and applications of or-
ganizational theory and behavior.

Intervention Interview Protocol
Overview

This protocol is designed to help Success Team Leads consider the team’s interventions by
exploring questions written through the lens of Bolman and Deal’s four leadership “frames” or
“orientations.” Participants should take the self-assessment on the following two pages to identify
their leadership frame/orientation prior to engaging in the protocol. Doing so will help the Team
Lead consider implications for practice and possible next steps.

Time Materials Rotating Roles

65-75 minutes if the Copies of each page of the Interviewer (who also serves
Leadership Orientations protocol as timekeeper), Interviewee
Assessment is not already Coptimally the Team Lead or

Watch/timer

completed; 55 minutes On-Track Coordinator), Scribe

if already completed

Process

1. Make sure participants complete the Leadership Orientations Self-Assessment. (10-15 minutes)

2. Once leadership orientations are identified, participants read through each of the roles,
noting that all participants will serve in each of the three roles during the protocol (interviewer,
interviewee, and scribe). State that the purpose of this protocol is to deepen and broaden the
perspective of the interviewee and that the interviewee reserves the right to decline answering
questions for which s/he currently holds no answer. (8 minutes)

3. Divide participants into triads and select initial roles. The interviewer begins with contextual
openers (on the interviewer’s sheet) and interviews the interviewee for 8 minutes. The scribe
follows along and takes notes in the appropriate boxes on the scribe sheet. Within the time
allotted, the interviewer may not ask all the questions on the sheet. This is okay. (8 minutes)

4. At the conclusion of the interview round, the scribe reads the notes s/he wrote to the
interviewee. The notes are given to the interviewee. (5 minutes)

5. Members of the triad then rotate roles and repeat steps 3 and 4, completing two more rounds of
interviews so that every member of the triad has been interviewed, has served as scribe, and has
served as interviewer. (13 minutes per round x 2 rounds = 26 minutes)

Interpreting Scores

1.

Structural (ST) leaders emphasize rationality, analysis, logic, facts, and data. They are likely to
believe strongly in the importance of clear structure and well-developed management systems.
A good leader is someone who thinks clearly, makes the right decisions, has good analytic skills,
and can design structures and systems that get the job done.

. Human resource (HR) leaders emphasize the importance of people. They endorse the view point

that the central task of management is to develop a good fit between people and organizations.
They believe in the importance of coaching, participation, motivation, teamwork, and good

interpersonal relations. A good leader is a facilitator and participative manager who supports
and empowers others.

Political (PL) leaders believe that managers and leaders live in a world of conflict and scarce
resources. The central task of management is to mobilize the resources needed to advocate

and fight for the unit’s or the organization’s goals and objectives. Political leaders emphasize the
importance of building a power base: allies, networks, coalitions. A good leader is an advocate
and negotiator who understands politics and is comfortable with conflict.

Symbolic (SY) leaders believe that the essential task of management is to provide vision and
inspiration. They rely on personal charisma and a flair for drama to get people excited and
committed to the organizational mission. A good leader is a prophet and visionary, who uses
symbols, tells stories, and frames experience in ways that give people hope and meaning.

Scribe:

Begin with the contextual openers. Responses to the contextual openers may prompt you to ask
clarifying questions, and that is fine. After gaining an understanding of the intervention plan, pose
questions from each of the four frames below. The goal is to help the interviewee think critically
about the content, process, and goals of the intervention by engaging in all four frames. Provide
sufficient wait time and respect the respondent’s right to not answer a question.

Contextual Openers

What story from the data led your team to develop an intervention?
Summarize your intervention plan.

Structural Questions

« What systems do you have in place to facilitate
productive implementation of your intervention? For
example, how does the scheduling of your intervention
limit calendar conflicts?

How will you know if this intervention is effective for the
targeted group? Describe your intervention effectiveness
tracking system.

What type of adjustments may you have to make to your
intervention if the data indicates it is not effective for
your targeted group of students?

Political Questions
« Who appears most willing to implement the intervention?

¢« How are you addressing implementers who are showing
signs of not being on board with the plan?

* To whom can you go to advocate for the tools and
resources you need to successfully implement your
intervention?

¢ What political barriers do you need to address to give
your intervention a chance for success?

Human Resource Questions

Why this particular intervention for the targeted group
of students?

Thinking of the targeted students, what staff members
do you think will elicit participation and best effort from
students?

What were the criteria for selecting those who will
implement the intervention?

What is the capacity of the implementers to execute the
intervention successfully?

What training will those implementing the intervention

Symbolic Questions

How does your intervention align with your team’s
mission or purpose statement?

How is your team messaging the intervention to
students? Is it presented as punitive or supportive?

What celebrations do you have planned for students who
are making progress toward your On-Track and student
connection goals?

What tangible appreciation will those implementing the
intervention receive for engaging in it?

Date: Scribe:

You will be asked several questions to help you consider your intervention plan through all four
frames (structural, human resource, political, and symbolic). This protocol will be most helpful to
you if you respond honestly to the questions posed. It is okay to not have an answer for a question.
The goal is to broaden your perspective about the forces at work within your school context that
can help or hinder the success of your intervention. A description of the types of questions you will
be asked are outlined below.

Structural

These questions ask you to think about your intervention in terms of the structures and
systems necessary to achieve your defined goals.

Human Resource

These questions ask you to think about the people participating in your intervention, from
recipients to implementers.

Political

These questions ask you to think about how you advocate and acquire what you need to
implement your intervention.

Symbolic

These questions ask you to connect the intervention plan to the vision, mission, and/or purpose
of your team’s work.

Purpose

Success Teams are learning communities organized around the shared purpose
of supporting students to successfully transition to high school. As individuals,
team members may have differing philosophies and ideas on how to approach
this work. Regular community building provides opportunities for team
members to connect to a shared purpose as well as each other.

Tool Set A provides Team Leads with ideas for community building within
Success Teams.

How & When to Use

Community building is a part of Success Team work and related activities
should connect to the goals for the meeting. When creating a team meeting
agenda, Team Leads should preserve space and time for these activities. You
may be tempted to eliminate community building when short on time or when
you feel there are other important things to do. Resist the urge and make sure
community building is a regular segment of your team’s meeting.

The protocols and activities in Tool Set A set the stage for this work. For
instance, Compass Points is ideal for a new Success Team. The information
learned from this activity can help the Success Team determine the strengths
and areas for growth of each team member. Once completed, it is not
uncommon to hear members reference the findings. You might hear a team
member say, “Well, I’m an East, | need to know the big picture,” or “| know she’s
a South, so she’s concerned with our comfort right now.”

@: COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS

Forming Ground Rules (Creating Norms)

Developed by Marylyn Wentworth.

Gaining agreement around Ground Rules, or Norms, are important for a group that intends to work together
on difficult issues, or who will be working together over time. They may be added to, or condensed, as the
group progresses. Starting with basic Ground Rules builds trust, clarifies group expectations of one another,
and establishes points of “reflection” to see how the group is doing regarding process.

Time
Approximately 30 minutes

Process

1. Ask everyone to write down what each person needs in order to work productively in a group, giving
an example of one thing the facilitator needs, i.e. “to have all voices heard,” or “to start and end our
meetings when we say we will.” (This is to help people focus on process rather than product.)

2. Each participant names one thing from her/his written list, going around in a circle, with no repeats,
and as many circuits as necessary to have all the ground rules listed.

3. Ask for any clarifications needed. One person may not understand what another person has listed, or
may interpret the language differently.

4. If the list is VERY long — more than 10 Ground Rules — ask the group if some of them can be combined
to make the list more manageable. Sometimes the subtle differences are important to people, so it is more
important that everyone feel their needs have been honored than it is to have a short list.

5. Ask if everyone can abide by the listed Ground Rules. If anyone dislikes or doesn’t want to comply with
one of them, that Ground Rule should be discussed and a decision should be made to keep it on the list
with a notation of objection, to remove it, or to try it for a specified amount of time and check it again.

6. Ask if any one of the Ground Rules might be hard for the group to follow. If there is one or more,
those Ground Rules should be highlighted and given attention. With time it will become clear if it
should be dropped, or needs significant work. Sometimes what might appear to be a difficult rule
turns out not to be hard at all. “Everyone has a turn to speak,” is sometimes debated for example, with
the argument that not everyone likes to talk every time an issue is raised, and others think aloud and
only process well if they have the space to do that. Frequently, a system of checking in with everyone,
without requiring everyone to speak, becomes a more effective Ground Rule.

7. While work is in progress, refer to the Ground Rules whenever they would help group process. If one
person is dominating, for example, it is easier to refer to a Ground Rule that says, “take care with how
often and how long you speak,” than to ask someone directly to stop dominating the group.

8. Check in on the Ground Rules when reflection is done on the group work. Note any that were not
followed particularly well for attention in the next work session. Being sure they are followed, refining
them, and adding or subtracting Ground Rules is important, as it makes for smoother work and more
trust within the group.

Protocols are most powerful and effective when used within an ongoing professional learning community and facilitated by a skilled facilitator. To learn more

An Exercise in Understanding Preferences in Group Work

Developed in the field by educators.

Purpose
Similar to the Myers-Briggs Personality Inventory, this exercise uses a set of preferences which relate not to
individual but to group behaviors, helping us to understand how preferences affect our group work.

Note: See the third page, Compass Points Explanations Expanded, for additional descriptions of the 4
preferences.

Process
1. The room is set up with 4 signs on each wall — North, South, East, and West.

2. Participants are invited to go to the direction of their choice. No one is only one direction, but everyone
can choose one as their predominant one.

3. Each direction group answers the 5 questions (see next page) on a sheet of newsprint. When complete,
they report back to the whole group.

4. Processing can include:
¢ Note the distribution among the directions: what might it mean?
e¢ What is the best combination for a group to have? Does it matter?
e¢ How can you avoid being driven crazy by another direction?
¢ How might you use this exercise with others? Students?

North
Acting — “Let’s do it”;
likes to act, try things, plunge in

N
West East
Paying attention to detail — likes Speculating — likes to look at the

where and why before acting before acting

S

South

Caring — likes to know that
everyone’s feelings have been
taken into consideration and
that their voices have been
heard before acting

answering the following questions as a group.

1. What are the strengths of your style? (4 adjectives)

2. What are the limitations of your style? (4 adjectives)

3. What style do you find most difficult to work with and why?

4. What do people from the other directions or styles need to know about you so you can work together
effectively?

5. What do you value about the other 3 styles?

Ice Breakers and Warm-Ups

Shared at the June 2000 National Facilitators Meeting

The following exercises designed to help people get to know one another.
1. If you were to write your Autobiography, what would the title be and why.

2. Write on the inside of your tent card (table name card) a fact about yourself that no one would be
likely to guess. Read them out loud. Gives people a hook. (i.e., “Faith, who raises sheep.” )

3. Drawa picture that describes who you are -- can be symbols, colors, you doing something...

4 Create a flower. Each person puts one petal on the flower, on which is written something important
about them. If we can find something we all have in common we put it in the center.

5. Human Scavenger Hunt, where you find things interesting about each person from a list that might be
work related or not. Items like, find someone who has facilitated a protocol, someone who has taught
in another country, someone who has created a portfolio that works... People share who they found in
the whole group.

6. People at each table find four things they have in common and share with the large group as an
introduction. Can’t be anything about education. (At one table, all had an Uncle Harry they didn’t
like).

7. People post one clue about themselves (with no name) on a bulletin board. Later in the day, add
another clue beside the first clue (more if there is time) and people guess identities from the clues at
the end of the day. People make assumptions and then they find that it’s very revealing and fun.

8. Post cards from the edge. Bring a collection of wild postcards and hand them out. Each person finds
something in the post card that relates to their experience as a teacher or principal and shares that
with the group.

9. Give out pennies and look at the dates. Go around the room and share something that occurred for
you in the year of the penny. It can be something about your education (as a child, a teachers etc.) or it
can be just about life. You’Il need a good collection of pennies with varied dates.

10. Skittles. People grab one, there is a guide by color: Yellow, something you're doing this summer;
green, something about work; red, an adventure you've had in education, etc. Whatever you want for
categories.

12. Gingerbread people. Hand out Gingerbread people, who have a question on each of their body parts:
what gives you indigestion (stomach), what drives you crazy (head), what you love (heart), what you
bring (one leg), what you want to let go of, (hand) what you want to take away. Each person takes a
turn introducing themselves and answering the questions. They can write them in and post them all,
with their names on the Gingerbread people.

13. Draw your school - either a picture or a floor plan, show challenges, strengths - personalize school by
what you think makes it special. Share pictures.

14. Write down powerful learning experiences from when you were age 10 to 13. Share them.

15. Line up in birth order and share schooling in small groups that break up roughly by generations or
clusters of years and share out.

16. Movie titles that describe your school experience and why.

17. Change style indicator and score yourself, validate Conservers, Validators, and Initiators of Change,
Pragmatist. (You'll need the directions to do this)

18. Read Alexander’s Horrible Rotten Day (children’s book) aloud, then ask people to share their Bad
morning experiences.

19. Two truths and a lie: you share two things that are true and one lie about yourself (as an educator or a
person - decide on one) and the group tries to guess which one is the lie. “What you would like to be
true?” is the follow up question.

Protocols are most powerful and effective when used within an ongoing professional learning community and facilitated by a skilled facilitator. To learn more

Protocol Tool Set B can support Team Leads to facilitate difficult conversations that

connect team members to each other and the work of improving student
outcomes.

How & When to Use

When a Success Team Lead becomes aware of major conflicts and/or a lack
of progress due to team dynamics (i.e. conflicting priorities, philosophical
differences), there is a need to refocus efforts. We recommend the use of a
protocol from Tool Set B to create a safe space for honest and productive

Modified Hopes and Fears Protocol

Purpose

To acknowledge the impact
of a significant event and to
create space for members

to anchor themselves in the
hopes they hold for their work
together moving forward.

Agreements

Timing & Grouping Supplies

This protocol can vary from 20
to 60 minutes, depending on
the size of the group and the
range of members’ concerns. If
the group is particularly large,
the facilitator can ask table
groups to work together and
then report out.

Newsprint/chart paper, sticky
notes, writing utensils, markers

¢ Confidentiality - Our personal stories stay in. Our shared commitments are socialized.

¢ No judgment zone - Different events impact people in different ways. We agree to listen to one
another with a compassionate ear.

¢ Solutions-oriented discourse - While we are sharing our fears, we acknowledge that they can
cause stagnation. Therefore, we commit to stepping into our hopes.

Steps

1. Introduction. The facilitator names the impactful event and asks members to silently write ona
sticky note their greatest fear or concern about it. Then, the facilitator asks them to think about
their greatest hope for the work moving forward and to write it on a separate sticky note.

2. Pair Share. The facilitator asks members to share their fears and hopes with a partner.

3. Listing. Members create a “Fears” column and a “Hopes” column on a sheet of newsprint/chart
paper using their sticky notes. All fears and hopes are posted without comment or judgment.

Note: if the group is particularly large, create smaller groups for this step and assign a scribe.

4. Processing. The facilitator provides time for members to silently read the lists.

5. Discussion Questions. What trends or themes do you see in the fears? In the hopes? Based on
the trends in our hopes, what 2 or 3 commitments can we focus on to propel our work together?

For groups that have been divided into smaller groups -

6. Each group will discuss the questions in step 5 and report out one core theme around fears,
one core theme around hopes, and one commitment. Facilitator scribes the commitments on
newsprint/chart paper.

7. The facilitator asks, “Of the commitments listed, which 2 or 3 will we collectively agree to move
forward?” Remind the team that the commitments anchor how we interact with one another to
realize the hopes we hold for our work.

8. Debrief the process. How was this process helpful? In what ways did it challenge or push you?
How might you use this protocol in your practice?

A Few Facilitation Tips

The facilitator can participate by listing his or her fears and hopes as well.

Do not skip steps! For some, just writing their fears and hopes is personally cathartic.
For others, it is the collective consideration of the impact which will be powerful in setting
commitments moving forward.

Remember, the commitments made serve as an anchor for your work moving forward. In
debriefing with the lead(s) of the team or group, explicitly ask how these commitments are
embedded in the work.

18 Leadership

learning

eriod 2 common planning time at

River High School: Five minutes

after the last bell, Team 9B teach-

ers are amiably catching up on
one another’s weekends while waiting for
the perpetual stragglers to arrive.

Maria, the team leader, seems to be the
only one with a sense of urgency. “People,
remember our norm of getting started
promptly,” she implores. “Let’s go. We need
to spend a few minutes planning April’s field
trip. Then we have to talk about how we’re
doing with the interdisciplinary writing
prompts.”

Before Maria has finished distributing a
short agenda, Principal Knox arrives. He’s
on his daily walkthrough this period and
cannot stay, but he wants to encourage the
group with a “little pat on the back.”

Al Knox is proud of his Professional
Learning Community initiative at River
High School. He has provided his PLCs with
common meeting time, stipends for team
leader(s), and summer training in norm de-
velopment and agenda setting. Compared
to the fractious group of ninth-grade teach-
ers he saw two years ago, 9B is collaborat-
ing pretty well, Al thinks. He is pleased by
the congenial tone of the gathering and the

team’s shared goal to improve student writ-
ing —a school priority. After a quick thanks
for their efforts, Al continues his walk and
leaves 9B to get on with its business.

If Al had stayed longer, the unfolding in-
teraction might have made him reconsider
his assessment. Instead of a few minutes, the
field trip discussion took more than half the
meeting. A tangent into a student discipline
issue chewed up another 15 minutes.

Team 9B got to the main agenda item
with 10 minutes left. At that point, two
teachers admitted that they were not getting
to the writing prompts despite previous
promises. John “never could find the time”
and Tina complained about “doing English
in science.” Colleagues’ comments were dis-
mayingly solicitous:

“That’s OK, John. Get to it when you
can.”

“Listen, your low group isn’t going to
be able to write much anyway. Maybe you
could just experiment with one of your good
sections.”

No one expressed dismay over how time
had been used or the failure to address the

By Alexander D. Platt and Caroline E. Tripp


--- Page 215 ---
one agenda item that would have a direct
impact on student performance. No one
made a passionate plea about the serious gap
in writing achievement. No one took a col-
league to task for violating the team agree-
ment, thereby granting tacit permission to
the notion that individual autonomy takes
precedence over responsibility to the group.

If we measure collaboration in terms of
impact on teaching and learning, the meet-
ing was a failure, and the group’s perfor-
mance inadequate.

False hope

Team 9B is one of many learning com-
munities with the worthwhile mission of
improving student learning springing up all
over California. Some do indeed fulfill the
promise of professional learning set forth
by DuFour and others. But as Michael Ful-
lan warns us from his research, “[We] have
found that professional learning commu-
nities are being implemented superficially.
They give the educators involved a false
hope of progress.”

To fulfill the promise of professional
learning communities, skillful leaders need
to do more than simply marshal resources
and cheer faculty on from the sidelines. We
must distinguish between groups that gen-
uinely pool their mental effort to develop
organizational intelligence in the service
of greater student learning — what we call
Accountable Communities — and groups
whose interactions block improvement and
protect mediocre performance by both stu-
dents and adults.

Three different prototypes fall into the
latter category: the Toxic Community, the
Laissez-Faire Community and the Conge-
nial Community. Although they may look
different, each group:

* accepts or tolerates low performance,
inertia or lack of contribution from its own
members;

* expects and accepts low performance
from groups of students who have somehow
been labeled as less worthy or less capable;

* attributes poor student achievement
to external factors like family background,
lack of financial support for schools or com-
munity conditions;

+ derives benefit from, and therefore ex-

erts effort to sustain, conditions that favor
adult comfort or convenience over student
needs;

+ has little or no collective experience
with, or models for, effective problem-solv-
ing skills and strategies.

Real schools are full of such underper-

forming groups, many of which parade

To fulfill the promise of PLCs,
skillful leaders need to do
more than simply marshal
resources and cheer faculty on

from the sidelines.

as “effective teams.” As you examine the
profile descriptions that follow, and the
suggested approaches for taking on such
groups, consider how you would use them
to diagnose and help Team 9B. Consider
whether any of the groups in your school
display similar characteristics and what you
and your leadership team might do.

The Toxic Community

As their name implies, toxic groups are
distinguished by their “negative take” on al-
most all aspects of schooling and by their real
or perceived ability to stifle initiative, punish
heretics (anyone who takes a leader’s side on
an issue), derail emerging solutions to prob-
lems, and blame everyone but themselves for
mediocre student or adult learning.

Sarcastic humor and weary cynicism

bind vocal members together in an “us ver-
sus them” or “this too shall pass” stance that
serves to protect members from external
demands and to drive non-subscribers to
silence or to the safety of other spaces.

Toxicity may result from patterns of dis-
trict bungling, including lack of supervision
and feedback or lingering resentments over
past injuries, such as strikes or destructive
bargaining sessions. Toxicity is also fueled
by emotional exhaustion from years of “ini-
tiative overload” and unsupported effort
and continual stirring ofa few “ringleaders”
who derive gratification and a sense of pur-
pose from being aggrieved.

By nature guarded and suspicious, toxic
groups do pay attention to what the orga-
nization wants from them and to the ways
in which organizational goals or changes in
practice might affect their traditional rights
and privileges. They often use the union
contract to defend the status quo.

Rather than embracing promising ideas
on their merits or supporting leaders who
want to find ways of trying out new practices
within the framework of the contract, Toxic
Communities vote for and encourage union
leaders who take a tough, protective stance.

Finally, Toxic Communities focus on
why things should not be done, cannot work
or are a problem for something that already
exists. Thus, members most often present
themselves as blockers to improvement ef-
forts and as individuals whose job is to sort,
select and label both children and other
adults.

New teacher induction programs are
no match for these lethal culture builders!
Challenging these communities requires a
balance of listening, acknowledging and di-
rect intervention. These highly negative cul-
tures almost always require some changes in
personnel.

Approaches for tackling Toxic Communities

* Identify the past or present causes for
the toxicity (previous authoritarian leader-
ship, residue from strikes and contract im-
passes, a track record of broken promises
from the district).

+ Build bridges before lighting fires (Len-
cioni, 2002). Listen to and acknowledge
previous conditions and past contributions

September/October 2008 19


--- Page 216 ---
to the current situation before asking for
changes.

* Give feedback to individuals when ex-
pectations for effective collaboration are not
met, but avoid attacking or labeling state-
ments. Instead, focus on the importance of
pooling knowledge to better help students
and name the consequences for students
when adults are unable to collaborate.

* Adopt and consistently use structures
that equalize participation in discussion
and minimize opportunities for harangu-
ing and bullying.

* Use transparent, data-based processes
for identifying student learning problems
and setting priorities for action, rather than
unstructured decisions by acclaim or asser-
tion.

* Honor contract provisions consistently,
but persist with clear non-negotiables and
expectations. Do not let grievances distract
from your focus.

* Remove the most negative individual or
a destructive ringleader from the group.

The Laissez-Faire Community

While Toxic Communities are often
bonded by their sense of injury or by a com-
mon vision of “the other” as enemy, groups
we have designated Laissez-Faire share little
beyond a desire or belief in their right to be
left alone to “do their own thing.”

In Laissez-Faire Communities, teachers
or administrators co-exist pleasantly but are
disconnected from institutional goals and
from each other’s work and work concerns.
Members are largely motivated by personal
needs either for comfort and convenience or
for instructional autonomy; no shared pur-
pose or vision drives their interaction.

If Toxic Communities snarl and snort in
response to requests for collaborative prob-
lem solving, Laissez-Faire Communities
sniff and sigh with martyred resignation.
The school’s designated goals do not ap-
pear to have immediate relevance or utility.
Rather than adversarial, as in Toxic Com-
munities, relationships with leaders are
often collusive: “You scratch my back, Pll
scratch yours.”

20 Leadership

Laissez-Faire Communities frequently
evolve in heavily decentralized districts or
schools in the absence of strong leadership.
They also develop when leadership defines
its role as protection of cooperative mem-
bers and motivation through favors and
deals. These communities tend to support
mediocre learning because they see it as
an inevitable result of student limitations
and because examining and subsequently
changing one’s core practice would violate
the fundamental value of autonomy.

Approaches for intervening with
Laissez-Faire Communities

«Identify the practices and forces that
are supporting autonomous actions, deal-
making, secrecy or low expectations.

* Determine when and how the group
interacts well to solve a problem (even if it
is low-level) and build on established struc-
tures or norms.

* Establish clear problem-solving struc-
tures and make problem solving a central
part of meeting agendas. Use time effi-
ciently.

* Assess how much time is wasted on un-
important topics; be judicious in identify-
ing the most important problems for the
focus of collaborative action.

* Monitor how time is spent during group
meetings; collect agendas and minutes.

* Help teams use standards and feedback
to define acommon learning problem, iden-
tify a change goal for itself, and establish
how it will monitor its own performance.

* Offer options for initial structuring of
joint work. Looking at student work, devel-
oping common assessments and examining
student test results could all be productive
starting points.

* Have much of the work done in course-
alike pairs or trios where there is compelling
rationale for working together.

The key to improving the collaboration
of these autonomous units is to help them
see that joint work will help them be more
effective in their own classrooms.

The Congenial Community

Congenial Communities are “happy” or
“nurturing” places to work. These groups
send off the false aura of smoothly func-


--- Page 217 ---
tioning teams. Considerable effort goes
into building and maintaining adult rela-
tionships and comfort, but unlike Toxic or
Laissez-Faire Communities, they have no
difficulty with requests to collaborate.

Members usually enjoy one another’s
company and have positive or neutral re-
lationships with the leaders. Mediocrity is
sustained because members do not chal-
lenge one another’s ideas and practices in
service of better student learning, because
getting along comes first.

Problems are quickly reduced to sim-
plistic statements and solutions, and no
real effort is made to examine data to get at
the core practices that are no longer serv-
ing children’s needs. Congenial Communi-
ties especially can be by-products of leader
shortcomings.

Recognizing that good relationships and
trust create effective teams, administrators
often overstress the role of congeniality and
inadvertently send signals that getting along
is paramount. Such leaders see themselves
as being responsible for keeping peace and
harmony, and worry that any attempt to
press for genuine changes in practice will
“undermine school morale” without pro-
ducing results.

Thus, everyone understands that nam-
ing an ineffective practice goes against
established cultural norms, and difficult
questions about poor student or adult per-
formance are swept under the rug.

Approaches for intervening with
Congenial Communities

+ Lead with relationship building and the
need for acceptance and affiliation, but use
data to reframe focus from adult comfort to
students’ losing out.

+ Help congenial groups be more accept-
ing of conflict by adopting protocols that
assist members in managing conflict (see
National School Reform Faculty Web site,
www.nsrfharmony.org).

+ Invest in training that helps members
to identify their own preferential styles and
conflict-aversive behavior, and analyze the
consequence of “burying” difficult infor-
mation or important disagreements.

+ Invite community members to examine
their own performance against criteria for a

Six Secrets of Change; How Leaders Learn

ive mea good theory over a strategic plan any day of the week,” is the
opening sentence of Michael Fullan’s latest book. It is a guide for both
business and education leaders who want to make their organizations
“survive and thrive.” Six “secrets” are offered as a theory of action, with the caution
that leaders be open to “surprises or new data that direct further action.”

The secrets are not likely to surprise you as they deal with the way leaders treat
employees, define purpose, build capacity, learn, share information, and create orga-
nizations that learn. Fullan cautions that for the secrets to work they must all be nur-
tured, as none are sufficient in isolation of the others. For me, the six secrets provide
a useful filter for examining the efficacy of decisions and actions.

ordon Donaldson credits Joanne Iskin, a principal in California’s Lennox
Unified School District, for insisting that this book get written. In it Don-
aldson provides a model (Interpersonal-Cognitive-Intrapersonal or I-C-I)
that he has found useful for understanding performance and learning. The book
provides real examples of how teacher leaders and principals have used the I-C-I
model to provide a framework for their own leadership of learning. Donaldson as-
serts, “Persistent hurdles to leader effectiveness are the result, in part, of gaps of lead-

ers’ interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cognitive knowledge sets.”

One aim of the book is to help leaders understand that their focus can not be their
own skill set, but must include increasing their understanding of how what they do
affects the “knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practice” of those they are leading.
Donaldson also reminds us that the highest purpose of leadership of schools is to
lead in ways that increase student learning.

collaborative and accountable community
and identify goals for growth.

Team 9B is certainly not a Toxic group.
It is probably more a hybrid. It has qualities
that mark it as Laissez-Faire: spending time
on topics not focused on teaching and learn-
ing and embracing individual autonomy as a
primary value. The aversion to conflict and
the cultural norm of guarding the friendly
climate marks it more as a Congenial team.

The exact classification, however, is less
important for leaders than being clear about
how to monitor, supervise and coach Team
9B to work in ways that are more likely to
impact student learning. This requires that
leaders recognize malfunctioning teams
and adopt a toolkit of intervention strategies
listed above. They also need a clear vision of
what a high-performing team looks like.

The Accountable Community:
The vision of excellence

Accountable Communities are the much
desired but rarely achieved ideal for team
functioning. They are demanding and
sometimes uncomfortable places to work.
Labeling a community as “accountable”
means its members have moved beyond
merely working together well in service of
students in general. The team takes direct
responsibility for monitoring its own ac-
tions and for calling others on behaviors and
stances that are not helpful to the mission.

Accountable Communities impact the
consistency and quality of members’ class-
room instruction more than teams function-
ing at other levels. Accountable Communi-
ties live a “no quarter, no excuses” existence,
where every choice a teacher makes is open
to examination and revision when there are
students who have not yet learned what they
need to learn.

Could you describe any of your teams as
accountable? Do you have some good teams
who could stretch to this level of perfor-
mance?

These communities are bonded and mo-
tivated by the glue of common goals, com-
mon agreements, common assessment and/
or common students. They do not depend
on external authorities to police them; they
are able to connect their classroom work to
larger organizational goals.

the entire team.

Becoming accountable

e can’t expect all teams to become accountable overnight, but we do expect
leaders to actively confront Fullan’s worry that “professional learning commu-
nities are being implemented superficially,” by taking four actions.
Be committed to strong measures of accountability and intervention in cases of
malfunctioning teams. There will be no spontaneous outbreak of improvement
without intervention, feedback and coaching.
Give “life and clout” to the California Standards for the Teaching Profession Stan-
dard No. 6: Developing as a Professional Educator, especially 6.3 — Working with
Communities to Improve Professional Practice (“Inspect what you expect”). Use
existing evaluation standards to reward contribution and recommend growth where

3 Develop clear definitions and images for what constitutes a high functioning, “ac-
countable” PLC that impacts student learning. Share these descriptions with
teams so they can self assess their performance.
Collect data on what is actually happening. If the principal had really observed
Team 9B, he would have been able to give growth feedback to the team leader or

Accountable Communities are the
much desired but rarely achieved
ideal for team functioning. They
are demanding and sometimes

uncomfortable places to work.

Because of the emphasis on problem
solving and the constant fine-tuning that
goes on in Accountable Communities, the
impact of their teaching on student learn-
ing is less random. Through their skilled
problem solving, they relentlessly address
learning gaps (concepts not yet understood
and skills not yet mastered) for both adults
and students.

There is a willingness to move beyond
the most obvious solutions and responses to
problems and seek other explanations and
opportunities. They let go of treasured but
non-working approaches when faced with
data indicating their lack of success. When
the knowledge of the group falls short, they
seek external expertise.

Accountable Communities do not col-
laborate on everything. They are very se-
lective and are known to push back against

principals who have gone overboard on
collaboration. Ironically, these groups are
marked as much by what they don’t collabo-
rate about! Some have described this as “re-
lentless focus” on matters of instruction and
learning (see box above).

If school leaders want to maximize the
power of PLCs, they need to not just sup-
port, but monitor and coach. Otherwise,
we will have a few great teams, fewer great
schools and many students performing
below our hopes.

Conversations in Schools that Improve
Student Achievement

Schools that make the most learning gains for students have leaders who ensure the frequency and
quality of professional conversations. Conversations among adults about teaching and learning
permeate the building. That means they happen at all times of day, in formal and informal settings,
and all the adults involve themselves.

The conversations:

e are substantive

* use recent information about student performance

¢ spring from questions that assume responsibility and capacity to improve student learning
e are non-defensive

e enable people to know things about each other as people

e reach out to Professional Knowledge

e lead to action

Listen in as you walk around the building....meetings, teachers’ lounge, hallways. If you hear
conversations like this, you can be sure the school is improving student results.

“Substantive” means they are talking concretely about teaching and learning itself, and the issues,
decisions and actions teachers are taking in daily practice with specific students.

“Based on recent information” means teachers bring specific and timely evidence about how students are
doing to the table. It could be from yesterday’s work as well as quarterly assessments, writing samples, test
scores: whatever will illuminate where students are and what they need next.

“Spring from questions” means the conversations are asking questions about the connection between
teacher action and student results with an assumption that it is our job to improve student results, and
that we are able to do so.

“Non-defensive” means that when students don't learn, teachers face the evidence squarely and accept
responsibility for their part. They don't get hung-up in guilt or blame of themselves or of the students.
Thus they are always working on how to adjust their actions to improve student results.

“Each other as people” means that staff members come to know one another as individuals who have life
histories and interests and commitments.

“Reaching out to Professional Knowledge” means that these conversations do not happen in a vacuum.
The teachers are aware that there is a vast reservoir of Professional Knowledge created by peers over the
past century; and they need to bring this Professional Knowledge into their planning and their problem
solving in order to maximize student success.

“Lead to action” means the conversations go beyond being interesting and satisfying for the participants.
They lead to changes in instruction that benefit students. These changes can be seen, heard, and
measured in their positive results.

ATLAS
Looking at Data

Learning from Data is a tool to guide groups of teachers discovering what students, educators, and the
public understand and how they are thinking. The tool, developed by Eric Buchovecky, is based in part on
the work of the Leadership for Urban Mathematics Project and the Assessment Communities of Teachers
Project. The tool also draws on the work of Steve Seidel and Evangeline Harris-Stefanakis of Project Zero at
Harvard University. Revised November 2000 by Gene Thompson-Grove. Revised August 2004 for Looking
at Data by Dianne Leahy.

1. Getting Started

e The facilitator reminds the group of the norms.

e The educator providing the data set gives a very brief statement of the data and avoids explaining
what she/he concludes about the data if the data belongs to the group rather than the presenter.
Note: Each of the next 4 steps should be about 10 minutes in length. It is sometimes helpful for the
facilitator to take notes.

2. Describing the Data (10 minutes)

¢ The facilitator asks: “What do you see?”

e During this period the group gathers as much information as possible from the data.

¢ Group members describe what they see in data, avoiding judgments about quality or interpretations.
It is helpful to identify where the observation is being made — e.g., “On page one in the second
column, third row...”

e If judgments or interpretations do arise, the facilitator should ask the person to describe the evidence
on which they are based.

e It may be useful to list the group’s observations on chart paper. If interpretations come up, they can
be listed in another column for later discussion during Step 3.

3. Interpreting the Data (10 minutes)

e The facilitator asks: “What does the data suggest?” Followed by — “What are the assumptions we
make about students and their learning?”

¢ During this period, the group tries to make sense of what the data says and why. The group should try
to find as many different interpretations as possible and evaluate them against the kind and quality of
evidence.

e From the evidence gathered in the preceding section, try to infer: what is being worked on and why?

¢ Think broadly and creatively. Assume that the data, no matter how confusing, makes sense to some
people; your job is to see what they may see.

e As you listen to each other’s interpretations, ask questions that help you better understand each
other’s perspectives.

Protocols are most powerful and effective when used within an ongoing professional learning community and facilitated by a skilled facilitator. To learn more
about professional learning communities and seminars for facilitation, please visit the School Reform Initiative website at www.schoolreforminitiative.org.


--- Page 226 ---
4. Implications for Classroom Practice (10 minutes)
e The facilitator asks: “What are the implications of this work for teaching and assessment?” This
question may be modified, depending on the data.
e Based on the group’s observations and interpretations, discuss any implications this work might have
for teaching and assessment in the classroom. In particular, consider the following questions:
— What steps could be taken next?
— What strategies might be most effective?
— What else would you like to see happen? What kinds of assignments or assessments could provide
this information?
— What does this conversation make you think about in terms of your own practice? About teaching
and learning in general?
— What are the implications for equity?

5. Reflecting on the ATLAS-Looking at Data (10 minutes)

Presenter Reflection:
e¢ What did you learn from listening to your colleagues that was interesting or surprising?
e¢ What new perspectives did your colleagues provide?
e How can you make use of your colleagues’ perspectives?

Group Reflection:
e¢ What questions about teaching and assessment did looking at the data raise for you?
¢ Did questions of equity arise?
e How can you pursue these questions further?
e Are there things you would like to try in your classroom as a result of looking at this data?

6. Debrief the Process (5 minutes)
¢ How well did the process work?
¢ What about the process helped you to see and learn interesting or surprising things?
e¢ What could be improved?

Protocols are most powerful and effective when used within an ongoing professional learning community and facilitated by a skilled facilitator. To learn more
about professional learning communities and seminars for facilitation, please visit the School Reform Initiative website at www.schoolreforminitiative.org.

provides examples on how one NCS partner school approached student

On-Track Unit Plan engagement around On-Track goals.

How & When to Use

Success Teams can use Tool Set D to generate their own ideas for the work.
It is important to distribute activities and responsibilities among team mem-
bers to avoid burnout.

Success Team conversations focused on supporting incoming freshmen
should happen in the spring so the team is ready to maximize opportunities,
such as freshman orientation, later in the summer to engage students.

The Freshman Success Framework is the foundation for effective school practice on
On-Track and student success. The Network for College Success has seen the great-
est and most sustainable gains for freshmen when schools develop high-functioning
educator professional learning communities, which we call Success Teams.

This Tool Set focuses on the below actions of a Success Team stemming from the
Freshman Success Framework.

Ideas for Engaging Students to Stay On Track

Summer Prior to Entering Ninth Grade

Begin exposing incoming freshmen to the concept of On-Track through transition activities. Use current
students to deliver this information whenever possible! Possible activities include:

¢ Pre-Orientation/High School Investigation Day

¢ Freshman Connection

* Department teacher phone calls and/or individual meetings

¢ Back-to-School Orientation in August

Quarter 1

Get into the specifics about what freshmen must do to be considered On Track. Example activities:

Grade-level assembly during Ist week of school, market as “On-Track pep rally”
Classroom guidance lessons (On-Track Unit)

Have students evaluate their first 5-week progress report. Using On-Track criteria, students evaluate
whether they are On Track or off track. Can be done through any class, advisory period, or during a
guidance lesson.

Post pictures of On-Track students in lunchroom or high-traffic area
Tie Ist quarter awards to On-Track status

All freshman teachers should use On-Track language in their classes and relate students’ performance in
their classes to being On Track or off track

Small group meetings with off track students, led by upperclassmen

Ideas for Engaging Students to Stay On Track

Quarters 2-3

Don’t let the fire burn out from 1st quarter! Students will pick up on it and begin to think that it’s not
important anymore. Continue the On-Track talk throughout the 2nd and 3rd quarters. Example
activities:

On-Track breakfast club
Field trips only for On-Track students

Facilitate healthy department competition, such as a pizza party for the department with the most
On-Track students

Small group meetings for marginally off track students, led by upperclassmen
One-on-one meetings for severely off track students, led by counselors, teachers, or administrators
Grade-level meetings that center around On-Track trends for the entire grade

Department/or advisory activities that help students to track their own data, such as attendance rate,
number of D’s/F’s, detentions, etc.

Gradebook checks that occur once weekly during a class (rotate which class throughout school year,
so time is not taken from the same class each time)

Pass out FAQs or myths/facts that clear up any misconceptions about being off track

Quarter 4

During the final quarter, help each student understand what he/she must do in order to get back On
Track. This is often very time-consuming because it is so highly individualized and may vary from student
to student. Dividing students among the Success Team and using adult mentors can help alleviate the
burden.

Small group or one-on-one meetings with off track students. At the end of the meeting, students
should be able to articulate exactly what they need to do to get back On Track.

It is important to communicate to students that they can ALWAYS get back On Track, no matter how
off track they may currently be. It may take more work for some students, but it is always possible.

Culminating On-Track field trip or reward that students can work toward
Final On-Track awards given at end-of-year ceremony

Expose students to their sophomore year On-Track “to-do” list

Assessing Success

Team Progress

Contents Purpose
Freshman Success Success Teams should regularly assess their progress to determine strengths
Inventory and areas in need of growth. Assessment should not be limited to the

performance of the team as a unit. It should include the performance of the
Success Analysis Protocol Team Lead and administrators responsible for supporting the team.

Success Team in Action:

Hancock High School How & When to Use
Video

Success Teams should build time into their routines for assessment, reflection,
and action planning. The Network for College Success encourages quarterly
informal assessments. This allows the team to pause and celebrate successes.
Regular team assessment can also reveal areas of concern that may require the
team to set additional goals or take a new approach to the work.

Success Teams should approach assessment as a collaborative process
grounded in a clear set of criteria or expectations for team performance.

The Freshman Success Inventory is based on the NCS Freshman Success
Framework (see the Framework in the About section of this Toolkit). The
Inventory allows each team member to reflect on and respond to the criteria,
after which the results are compiled so the entire team can determine a final
performance level. Based on the data, teams are encouraged to set quarterly
goals and action plans.

The video on Hancock High School showcases a high-functioning Success
Team engaging in a solutions-oriented conversation about their students.

Success Analysis Protocol
For Leadership Teams

Developed in the field by educators.

Roles
A timekeeper/facilitator

The facilitator’s role is to help the group to keep focused on how this practice is different from other team
practices. The analysis of what makes this practice so successful is the purpose of the protocol.

“Best Practice” is defined as a process that proved to be highly effective in achieving the intended
outcome.

1. Discuss as a team and then write a short description of the one “Best Practice” of your team this year.
Note what it is about the practice that made it so successful. Be sure to answer the question, “What
made this experience different from other team experiences?” Identify a person to report on the team’s
success and the analysis of what made it successful. (20 minutes)

2. The Reporter shares their team’s “Best Practice” and why it was so successful. (3 minutes)

3. The other team asks clarifying questions about the details of the “best practice”. (3 minutes)

4. The group does an analysis of what they heard about the presenter’s success and offers additional
insights about how this practice is different than other team practices. Probing questions are appropriate
and the presenter’s participation in the conversation is encouraged. (3-5 minutes)

5. The presenter responds to the group’s analysis of what made this experience so successful. (1 minute)

6. The other team’s Reporter shares their “Best Practice” and what made it so successful. Repeat steps 3-5.
(10-12 minutes)

7. Debrief the protocol as a whole group. Possible questions: What worked well? How might we apply
what we learned to other team work? How might students use this process to reflect on their work?
What adaptations to this protocol might improve the process? (5 minutes)

Protocols are most powerful and effective when used within an ongoing professional learning community and facilitated by a skilled facilitator. To learn more
about professional learning communities and seminars for facilitation, please visit the School Reform Initiative website at www.schoolreforminitiative.org
